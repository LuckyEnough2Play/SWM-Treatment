# Extracted Tables from Harper Report

Below are cleaner versions of selected tables from the Harper report. The
original PDF contains many formatting artifacts, so only a subset of
tables are presented here in Markdown format for readability.

## Table 2-1 – Stormwater System Design Standards (Chapter 62‑25 FAC)


| Stormwater System Type | Design Parameter | Criteria |
|------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Retention** | Treatment Volume | Runoff from the first 1" of rainfall; or as an option, for projects <100 ac, 0.5" of runoff |
| | Volume Recovery | <72 hr following storm using percolation, evaporation, or evapotranspiration |
| **Swales** | Treatment Volume | Percolate 80% of the runoff from a 3‑yr/1‑hr storm within 72 hr following storm |
| | Volume Recovery | <72 hr following storm using percolation, evaporation, or evapotranspiration |
| **Dry Detention** | Treatment Volume | Runoff from the first 1" of rainfall; or as an option, for projects <100 ac, 0.5" of runoff |
| | Volume Recovery | <72 hr following storm |
| **Filter Systems (if applicable)** | Filter Design | - Permeability = surrounding soil <br> - Media washed with <5% silt, clay, and organic matter <br> - Media uniformity coefficient <1.5 <br> - Effective grain size from 0.20‑0.55 mm <br> - Designed with safety factor of 2 |
| **Wet Detention¹** | Treatment Volume | 1" of runoff |
| | Volume Recovery | <50% in 60 hr following storm |
| | Detention Time | Minimum 14 days |
| | Littoral Zone | Minimum 30% of pond area |
| | Pond Depth | Maximum 8‑10 ft below control elevation |
| **Exemptions** |  | - Required for wet ponds unless side slopes are less than 4:1 <br> - Facilities designed to accommodate only one single-family dwelling unit, duplex, triplex, or quadruplex, provided the unit is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale <br> - Facilities within developments of ≤10 acres total land area and <2 acres impervious surface <br> - Stormwater discharge facilities functioning to treat roadways consisting almost entirely of swales <br> - Facilities which discharge into a regional stormwater discharge facility <br> - Facilities for agricultural lands (with an approved Conservation Plan) <br> - Facilities for silvicultural lands (if constructed per Silviculture BMP Manual, 1979) |
