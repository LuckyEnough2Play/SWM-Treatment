# Extracted Tables from Harper Report

Below are cleaner versions of selected tables from the Harper report. The
original PDF contains many formatting artifacts, so only a subset of
tables are presented here in Markdown format for readability.

## Table 2-1 – Stormwater System Design Standards (Chapter 62‑25 FAC)

| Stormwater System Type | Design Parameter | Criteria |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Retention** | Treatment Volume | Runoff from the first 1" of rainfall; for projects <100 ac, 0.5" of runoff |
| | Volume Recovery | <72 hr using percolation, evaporation, or evapotranspiration |
| **Swales** | Treatment Volume | Percolate 80% of runoff from a 3‑yr/1‑hr storm within 72 hr |
| | Volume Recovery | <72 hr using percolation, evaporation, or evapotranspiration |
| **Dry Detention** | Treatment Volume | Runoff from the first 1" of rainfall; for projects <100 ac, 0.5" of runoff |
| | Volume Recovery | <72 hr following storm |
| **Filter Systems (if applicable)** | Filter Design | Permeability of surrounding soil; media washed with <1% fines, uniformity coefficient >1.5, effective grain size 0.20–0.55 mm, safety factor of 2 |
| **Wet Detention** | Treatment Volume | 1" of runoff |
| | Volume Recovery | <50% in 60 hr following storm |
| | Detention Time | Minimum 14 days |
| | Littoral Zone | Minimum 30% of pond area |
| | Pond Depth | Maximum 8–10 ft below control elevation |
| | Fencing | Required unless side slopes <4:1 |
| **Exemptions** | | Facilities for small residential projects, swale‑only systems, regional discharge facilities, agricultural lands with a Conservation Plan, and silvicultural lands following the Silviculture BMP Manual |
