 The authority to delegate implementation of the Stormwater Management Program within 

the State of Florida from FDEP to
 the various water management districts is provided in Chapter 62-
40.431.  This section provides that water manage
ment districts which have implemented a 
Comprehensive Surface Water Management Progr
am under Part IV of Chapter 373 (Florida 
Statutes) shall be the chief administrators of the 
State Stormwater Management Program within their 
districts.   Using this authority, FDEP has de
legated  responsibility  for  the  Stormwater 
Management Program to the Suwannee River, St. 
Johns River, Southwest Florida, and the South 
Florida Water Management Districts. Each of th
ese water management districts has developed a 
unique set of stormwater design criteria, modeled after the minimum design criteria outlined in 

Chapter 62-25 FAC, and designed to achieve the mi
nimum stormwater treatment standards specified 
in Chapter 62-40 FAC (Water Resource Implementation Rule). 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

 FDEP has not delegated authority for regulati
on of stormwater discharges to the Northwest 
Florida Water Management District since this di
strict does not have the economic and technical 
resources to implement a Comprehensive Surface Wa
ter Management Program at this time.  As 
such, FDEP has retained implementation of the Stat
e Stormwater Management Program in this area 
and provides permitting services for all new developm
ent within the Northwest Florida district based 
upon the stormwater system design standards outlined in Chapter 62-25 FAC. 

 

 A comparison of existing stormwater manage
ment design system criteria within the St. 
Johns River, Suwannee River, Southwest Florid
a, and the South Florida Water Management 
Districts is given in Table 2-
2.  Design criteria are summarized for each type of stormwater 
management system referenced w
ithin each of the four districts, including treatment volume, volume 
recovery, vegetation requirements, residence time, 
depth, and system configuration.  Criteria which 
do not directly impact the performance efficiency 
of the stormwater system (such as side slopes, 
minimum pipe sizes, vegetative planting success rates, etc.) are not listed in Table 2-2. 

 

 Each of the four water management districts 
provides design criteria for dry retention basins. 
In general, retention requirements are typically
 equivalent to the runoff volume generated by the 
first 0.5-inch of runoff or 1 inch of rainfall.  
Distinctions between off-line and on-line systems are 
provided in the design criteria by 
the St. Johns River and the Southwest Florida Water Management 
Districts, with increases in retention volume 
required for on-line systems.  Volume recovery 
requirements for retention basins vary, ranging fr
om full volume recovery in less than 72 hours in 
the St. Johns River, Suwannee River, and Southw
est Florida Water Management Districts, to 
recovery of 50% of the treatment volume in 
24 hours in the South Florida Water Management 
District.  The St. Johns River Water Management Dist
rict requires the retention basin to be stabilized 
with pervious material or vegetative cover, while 
vegetative cover is not referenced by the remaining 
districts. 
 
 Specifications for underdrain systems ar
e provided by the St. Johns River Water 
Management District only, with treatment volume 
requirements similar to those specified for dry 
retention.  Underdrain systems are not referenced by the remaining water management districts. 

 

 Underground exfiltration is specifically refe
renced by the St. Johns River, Southwest 
Florida, and South Florida Water Management Di
stricts.  In general, the treatment volume 
requirements for underground exfiltration systems are 
identical to those required for dry retention by 
the districts.  However, volume recovery require
ments vary substantially, with volume recovery 
required within 1 hour by the South Florida Water 
Management District and within 72 hours by the 
St. Johns River and Southwest Florida Water Management Districts. 

 

 The use of swales for stormwater treatment is
 referenced by both the St. Johns River and the 
Suwannee River Water Management Districts.  Each 
of these districts requires percolation of 80% of 
the runoff generated from a 3-year
/1-hour storm within the swale system, with recovery of the 
treatment volume in less than 72 hours.  The use 
of swales for stormwater treatment is not 
specifically referenced by either the Southwes
t Florida or South Florida Water Management 
Districts.

 Wet detention stormwater treatment is specifi
cally referenced by all the water management 
districts except the Suwannee River Water Manageme
nt District.   However, the Suwannee River 
Water Management District provides general detenti
on criteria which could be interpreted as either 
wet or dry systems.  In the three districts that
 provide references for wet detention, the required 
treatment volume is equivalent to 1 inch of runo
ff from the watershed or 2.5 inches of runoff from 
the impervious area, whichever is greater.  Volume recovery requirements are variable, with 

recovery of 50% of the treatment volume in 24-
30 hours in the St. Johns River Water Management 
District, 50% in 60 hours and 100% in 120 hours in
 the Southwest Florida Water Management 
District, and 50% recovery in 24 hours in the Sout
h Florida Water Management District.  Residence 
time, perhaps the most significant factor in determ
ining the overall performance efficiency of a wet 
detention system, is referenced only by the St. 
Johns River Water Management District which 
requires a minimum 14-day wet season residence 
time during the months from June-October. 
Littoral zone plantings are required by each of the 
three water management districts, ranging from 
20% in the South Florida Water Management Dist
rict to 35% in the Southwest Florida Water 
Management District.  Require
ments for pond depth, also an important design parameter, are 
provided by the St. Johns River a
nd South Florida Water Management Districts.  The St. Johns 
River Water Management District specifies sha
llow ponds, with a mean depth ranging from 2-8 ft 
and a maximum depth of 12 ft.  In contrast, 
the South Florida Water Management District 
recommends that 25-50% of the pond area be greater 
than 12 ft to provide storage for accumulated 
solids. 

 

 Specific references to design criteria for dry 
detention (without filtration) are provided by the 
St. Johns River and South Florida Water Manage
ment Districts.  The Suwannee River Water 
Management District mentions ﬁdetentionﬂ whic
h could be inferred to mean dry detention.  
Treatment volume requirements are somewhat variab
le, with 1 inch of runoff (or 2.5 inches from 
impervious areas) in an off-line system in the St
. Johns River Water Management District, the runoff 
from 1 inch of rainfall in the Suwannee River Wate
r Management District, and 0.5 inch of runoff (or 
1.88 inches x impervious area) in the South Florid
a Water Management District.  Volume recovery 
is also highly variable, with recovery of 50% 
of the treatment volume in 24 hours by the St. Johns 
River and South Florida Water Management District
s, and complete recovery in 72 hours within the 
Suwannee River Water Management District. 

 

 Detention with filtration systems are referen
ced by the St. Johns River, Suwannee River, and 
Southwest Florida Water Management Districts.  
In general, the treatment volume requirements for 
detention with filtration systems are identical to those required for dry retention systems. 

Specifi cations are also provided for the filter system which are virtually identical to the filter system 

criteria outlined in Chapter 62-25.  Treatment 
volume recovery ranges from 36 hours in the 
Southwest Florida Water Management District 
to 72 hours in the St. Johns River and Suwannee 
River Water Management Districts. 

 

 Each of the four water management distri
cts provides additional supplemental criteria for 
stormwater management systems which discharge 
to OFW, Class I or II waterbodies, or sensitive 
areas.  In general, an additional 50% treatment 
volume is required by the St. Johns River, Suwannee 
River, South Florida, and Southwest Florida Wate
r Management Districts for discharges to these 
waterbodies.  In addition to the enhanced treatme
nt volume, the St. Johns River Water Management 
District also requires an additional 50% perman
ent pool volume for wet detention ponds.  The South 
Florida Water Management District also requires additional assurances in the form of pre-treatment 

or other listed options.

 Basin-specific criteria have been developed 
by the St. Johns River and South Florida Water 
Management Districts to address flooding and water qua
lity concerns in sensitive basins.  In general, 
these basin-specific criteria require additional 
water quality treatment and/or water quantity 
protection within designated basins to achieve specific water quantity or water quality goals. 
 
 Each of the water management districts also
 provides design criteria which regulate the rate 
of discharge of stormwater from
 developed properties to prevent flooding.  In general, the post-
development rate of discharge for most projects is 
limited to values equal to or less than those which 
occur from the project site under pre-development 
conditions, generally for a 25-year design storm.  
However, since these criteria do not directly rela
te to the water quality aspects of stormwater 
management systems, they are not included in the discussion presented in this section. 

 

 
2.3  Local Governments
 
 
 In addition to the design criteria summarized in previous sections, local governments may 

also develop stormwater design criteria, includi
ng alternative design criteria, provided that the 
design criteria meet the overall objectives and wa
ter quality goals achieved by the design criteria 
provided by each of the water management dist
ricts.  Local governments typically include 
supplemental design criteria related to maintenance, safety, and aesthetic aspects of stormwater 

management systems such as maintenance berms, 
fencing, and design criteria for outfall structures 
to minimize transport of trash and other debris to downstream waterbodies. 

 

 Several governmental entities, such as Ma
rtin County and Leon County, have developed 
alternative stormwater design criteria designed to reduce post-development loadings from developed 

areas to levels equal to or less than pre-developmen
t loadings in areas within
 their jurisdiction.  In 
Martin County, this strategy was implemented on a 
county-wide basis, while in Leon County this 
strategy was developed only for the Bradfordville area.  In general, the design criteria developed for 

these areas to achieve no net increase in lo
adings under post-development conditions are 
substantially greater with respect to treatment vol
ume than existing design criteria currently utilized 
within the State of Florida.

 PRECIPITATION 
CHARACTERISTICS  IN  FLORIDA
 
 
 

 The need for stormwater treatment in Florid
a is fueled by the abundance of rainfall which 
occurs throughout the State.  The close proximity 
of Florida to the Atlan
tic Ocean and Gulf of 
Mexico, along with the State™s many inland lake
s and waterways, combine to generate high 
humidity and generally abundant and frequent 
rainfall.  However, although precipitation is 
generally abundant in Florida, annual precipitati
on amounts can vary greatly from year to year, 
and serious droughts have occurred periodically 
within the State.  Rainfall is unevenly 
distributed throughout the year in Florida, with
 more than half of the total annual rainfall 
occurring during the period from June-September 
when periods of extremely heavy rainfall are 
common.  The highest 24-hour rainfall ever record
ed in the United States, 38.7 inches, occurred 
in Yankeetown, Florida on September 5-6, 1950. 

 

 
3.1  Annual and Regional Precipitation
 
 
 In addition to variability in seasonal rainfall 
characteristics, a significant regional variability 
in annual precipitation has been observed throughout th
e State of Florida.  A
ccording to the National 
Climatic Data Center (NCDC), 111 meteorological 
stations are maintained throughout the State of 
Florida.  During February 2002, the NCDC released a summary of monthly and annual temperature 

and precipitation measurements at each of the 
111 stations over the 30-year period from 1971-2000. 
A summary of this information, including a loca
tion map for each of the 111 monitoring sites, is 
given in Appendix A.1. 

 

 A contour isopleth map of mean annual preci
pitation within the State of Florida was 
generated by ERD based upon the mean annual preci
pitation values for the 111 monitoring sites 
summarized in Appendix A.1.  Data from additiona
l meteorological monitoring sites in Alabama, 
Georgia, and Louisiana (generally within 100 mile
s of Florida) were also obtained to provide a 
smoother transition for the contour lines in the vici
nity of the State boundary.  The mean rainfall data 
obtained from these adjacent stations was also
 provided by the NCDC as summaries of data 
collected over the period 1971-2000.  An additional 
49 meteorological monitoring locations were 
included in this supplemental data set, for a total of 160 meteorological monitoring sites used for 

generation of rainfall contour isopleths.  A comple
te listing of geographical coordinates and mean 
annual rainfall from 1971-2000 is given in Appendix 
A.2 for each of the 160 monitoring sites, and 
locations of these monitoring sites are shown on Figure 3-1.

 An isopleth map of annual precipitation within 
the State of Florida during the 30-year period 
from 1971-2000, generated using the process outlined prev
iously, is given in Figure 3-2.  In general, 
average rainfall within the State ranges from approximately 38-66 inches/year, depending upon 

location within the State.  The greatest annual pr
ecipitation within the State occurs in western 
portions of the Florida Panhandle.  In addition to
 the summer time convective storms which affect 
most of the State, this area is also impacted
 by precipitation from frontal boundaries which often 
dissipate before reaching more southern portions of
 the State.  The lowest annual precipitation was 
recorded in the Florida Keys.   Expanded regional ve
rsions of the rainfall isopleths map are given in 
Appendix A.3.

 Additional regions of elevated rainfall, with annual precipitation ranging from approximately 

58-62 inches/year, are apparent in the Big Bend Coastal and the Southeast Coastal regions of the 

State.  The Big Bend Coastal area is impacted 
by many of the same precipitation processes that 
occur within the Panhandle region, while the Sout
heast Coastal region is impacted heavily by 
summer time convective thunderstorm activity.  The remaining portions of the State, excluding the 

Florida Keys, have annual precipitation ranging from
 approximately 45-55 inches/year, with lower 
precipitation in central portions of the State and higher precipitation in coastal areas.   

 

 In addition to the regional variability in m
ean annual precipitation illustrated on Figure 3-2, a 
significant variability also exists w
ith respect to the frequency and types of individual rain events 
which occur throughout the state.  For example, coasta
l areas (particularly in southern portions of the 
State) often have small convective rainfall events
 due to the proximity of open water.  A large 
number of the rain events which o
ccurred in these areas are less than 0.2 inches.  In contrast, areas 
within the Panhandle receive a large portion of th
eir annual rainfall from periodic frontal boundaries 
which typically dissipate before reaching other parts of the State.   

 

 The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)
 has collected long-term rainfall data at 
numerous precipitation recording stations within the St
ate of Florida.  This database was reviewed to 
identify rainfall recording stations which would be representative of rainfall conditions in various 

areas of the State.  Eleven separate meteorologi
cal stations were selected, scattered from the 
Panhandle to the Florida Keys, to examine variability 
in the characteristics of individual rain events 
across the State.  Locations of the selected me
teorological sites are indicated on Figure 3-3.  In 
general, it was desired that the monitoring stati
ons contain a maximum period of record with a 
minimum amount of missing data.   Years within th
e period of record which contain one or more 
months  of  missing  data  were  generally  excluded 
 from  the  database,  providing  a  data set with 
continuous rainfall data for each year included within the set. 

 

 Characteristics of the selected meteorological 
sites in Florida are summarized in Table 3-1. 
This table includes a descriptive name to identif
y the general location of the monitoring site, the 
mean annual rainfall measured at the monitoring 
site, and the period of record included in the 
meteorological data.  Continuous rainfall records 
were initiated in 1942 at seven of the 11 sites 
included in Table 3-1.  Records at four add
itional sites were begun between 1946 and 1949.  The 
period of rainfall records included in data sets fo
r each of the 11 sites is 
summarized in the final 
column of Table 3-1.  Each entry includes the peri
od of record as well as 
the number of years of 
complete data available for evaluation of rain event characteristics.

3.2  Rainfall Event Characteristics
 
 
 A probability distribution of individual rain ev
ents occurring during the period of record for 
each of the selected meteorological sites was de
veloped by evaluating common rain events occurring 
at each of the sites during an average year.  H
ourly meteorological data was obtained from the 
NCDC for each of the selected me
teorological sites.  The continuous hourly rainfall record for each 
site was scanned to determine the total rainfall dept
h for individual rain events which occurred at the 
monitoring site over the period of record.   

 

 For purposes of this analysis, a rain event is defined as a period of continuous rainfall.  The 

US EPA typically uses a 6-hour separation for defi
ning individual rain events.  Using this criterion, 
rain episodes separated by less than six hours of dr
y conditions are considered to be one continuous 
event, while rain events separated by six hours or mo
re of dry conditions are assumed to be separate 
events. The six-hour separation period is thought to 
be the minimum period of no rainfall required to 
restore the hydrologic characteristics of the site
 to pre-rain event conditions.  Although this 
definition may work well in the temperate climat
es present throughout much of the U.S., this 
definition fails to consider the small convective ev
ents which occur frequently within the State of 
Florida, particularly during the summer months. For rain events in the range of 0.25 inches or more, 

an inter-event separation period of approximately
 six hours seems adequate to restore hydrologic 
characteristics for a Florida watershed.  Howeve
r, for events less than 0.25 inches, hydrologic 
characteristics can be restored rapidly, often within
 several hours.  Therefore, for purposes of this 
evaluation, a variable inter-event dry period is utili
zed.  When the cumulative hourly rainfall is equal 
to 0.25 inches or more, an inter-event dry period of 
six hours is required to initiate the start of a new 
rain event.  Rainfall which occurs less than six hour
s from the termination of the previous rainfall is 
assumed to be part of the original rainfall event. 
 However, for rain events less than 0.25 inches, an 
inter-event dry period of three hours is used to indi
cate the start of a new independent runoff event. 
 

 The available data sets for each of the 11 mete
orological sites were scanned and divided into 
individual rain events based upon the criteria outlined 
previously.I n d iv id u al r ain f all ev en ts at each  
of the 11 monitoring sites were divided into
 19 rainfall event ranges which include 0.00-0.10 
inches,  0.11-0.20  inches,  0.21-0.30  inches
,  0.31-0.40 inches, 0.41-0.50 inches, 0.51-1.00 inch, 
1.01-1.50 inches, 1.51-2.00 inches, 2.01-2.50 inches, 2.51-3.00 inches, 3.01-3.50 inches, 3.51-

4.00 inches, 4.01-4.50 inches, 4.51-5.00 inches
, 5.01-6.00 inches, 6.01-7.00 inches, 7.01-8.00 
inches, 8.01-9.00 inches, and greater than 9 inches. For each rainfall event range, the mean depth 

of rain events within the interval was calcula
ted.  A probability distribution was performed on all 
rainfall events within each rainfa
ll event range to determine the average number of rain events, 
the mean rainfall duration, the mean anteceden
t dry period, the  annual  rainfall  depth  
contributed  by  each  interval,  the  cumu
lative  annual  event volume, and cumulative 
percentage of annual rainfall  for each rainfall event range.  Frequency distributions of rain 

events in each of the 11 meteorological sites are given in Appendix A.4.

A comparison of the percentage of annual rain
 events occurring within the selected event 
intervals at the regional sites is given in Table 3-
2.  In general, it appears that the Key West and 
Miami monitoring sites have a higher percentage
 of relatively small events, which generate 
relatively little measurable runoff, and a lower perc
entage of larger rain events, compared with 
the remaining monitoring sites.  For example, approximately 83.7% of the rain events occurring 

at the Key West monitoring site and 80.6% of the events occurring at the Miami monitoring sites 

are equal to 0.5 inch or less compared with a st
ate-wide average of 75.1%.  Conversely, the  Ft. 
Myers and Cross City monitoring sites appear to ha
ve a lower percentage of small rain events, 
with 72.6% of the events at the Ft. Myers site 
and 70.8% of the events at the Cross City site 
having rainfall depths equivalent to 0.5 inches 
or less.  The Pensacola, Tallahassee, and Ft.  
Myers monitoring sites appear to have a higher percen
tage of large rain  events,  with  5.3%  of 
the Pensacola and Tallahassee and 3.9% of the Ft. My
ers rain events equivalent to 2 inches or 
greater compared with a state-wide average of 3.6%
 for this interval.  A graphical comparison of 
the percentage of annual rainfall events less than 1 inch in depth at each of the designated 

regional sites is given in Figure 3-4.

monitoring sites.  This information was evaluated 
on both a dry season (October-May) and wet seas
on (June-September) basis.  Information on 
antecedent dry period is useful in evaluating recovery times for stormwater management systems 

which must recover stored treatment volumes prior to the next significant rain event.

SECTION  4 
 

 STORMWATER  RUNOFF Œ 
QUALITY  AND  QUANTITY
 
 
 

 The performance efficiency and effectiven
ess of stormwater treatment systems are 
closely linked to the quantity and quality of the ge
nerated stormwater stream.  Issues related to 
the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff form
 the basis of existing stormwater treatment 
design criteria.  A discussion of the quality a
nd quantity of stormwater runoff generated by 
various land use categories is given in the following sections. 

 

 
4.1  Water Quality Characteristics
 
 

4.1.1 DataAvailability
 
 
 A multitude of stormwater characterization studi
es have been conducted within the State of 
Florida as part of research projects, permit m
onitoring requirements, retrofit projects, and NPDES 
permitting.  Land use categories included in runoff ch
aracterization studies can typically be grouped 
into one of 12 general land use designations wh
ich are commonly used in pollutant loading 
evaluations.  A summary of these general land use categories is given in Table 4-1. 

 

 When performing pollutant loading studies for 
large watershed areas, land use information is 
often obtained as FLUCCS codes (Florida Land Use 
Code and Classification System).  This system 
typically provides multiple sub-categories for each 
of the 12 general land use categories summarized 
in Table 4-1 based upon differences in percen
tage imperviousness, vegetative cover, and 
development density.  Unfortunately, detailed runoff 
characterization data are not available for most 
of these sub-categories.  As a result, when pe
rforming pollutant loading studies, detailed land use 
categories represented by FLUCCS codes must ofte
n be assigned to one of the 12 general land use 
categories summarized in Table 4-1 for estimation 
of pollutant loadings.  This assignment is 
typically performed based upon anticipated sim
ilarities in hydrologic and pollutant loading 
characteristics between the detailed FLUCCS code designations and the general land use categories. 

 

 A summary of the availability of runoff charact
erization data for various pollutant categories 
and land use types is given in Table 4-2.  Good runo
ff characterization data is generally available for 
suspended solids in each of the land use categorie
s summarized in Table 4-1.  A similar level of 
characterization data availability is present for 
total nitrogen and total phosphorus in virtually all 
land use categories.  However, information on 
dissolved species of nitrogen and phosphorus is 
relatively limited in the existing literature.

 Runoff characterization data for zinc, lea
d, and copper are most commonly available for 
commercial, residential, and highway land uses.  Ho
wever, even in these categories, the availability 
of the data is only considered to be fair to
 good.  Information on other heavy metals, such as 
cadmium, chromium, and nickel, as well as dissolved 
metal species, is poor in virtually all land use 
categories.  The only studies which include these 
latter parameters appear to be research-related 
projects. 

 

 Runoff characterization data for biochemi
cal oxygen demand (BOD) is fair to good in 
commercial, residential, and highway land use cate
gories.  A limited amount of information for this 
parameter is also present in agricultural studi
es.  However, chemical oxygen demand (COD) is 
measured relatively infrequently, and the data ava
ilability for this parameter is considered poor to 
fair. 

 

 Oils, greases, and hydrocarbons are measured
 on an infrequent basis in stormwater 
characterization studies.  Most of the studies incl
uding these parameters are research projects, many 
of which are designed specifically to address th
ese compounds.  Oils, greases, and hydrocarbons are 
generally evaluated through the generic oil and 
grease or TRPH (total recoverable petroleum 
hydrocarbon) lab tests.  Testing for specific compounds is extremely rare within the literature. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

 Information on pathogens, such as total and fecal
 coliform, is poor in the available literature, 
with the majority of information addressing co
mmercial, residential, and highway land uses. 
Information on more specific pathogens, such as E. 
coli, is extremely poor for virtually all land use 
categories. 

 

 A literature review was conducted by Ha
rper during 1992-93 to identify significant 
stormwater characterization studies performed with
in the State of Florida. Bas ic information for 
many of the evaluated land uses was obtaine
d from the document by Harper (1994) titled 
ﬁStormwater Loading Rate Parameters for Central 
and South Floridaﬂ.  This report presents the 
results of an extensive literature search and 
analysis of runoff characteristics for selected 
parameters and land use types within Central 
and South Florida.  The runoff characteristics 
provided in this document include publications and studies conducted specifically within the 

State of Florida by a variety of state, fede
ral, and local governments, along with private 
consultants. 

 
Each study was reviewed for adequacy of the 
database, with special attention to factors 
such as length of study, number of runoff events monitored, monitoring methodology, as well as 

completeness and accuracy of the work.  In general, it is preferred that selected studies present at 

least a one-year period of data collection represen
ting a wide range of rainfall and antecedent dry 
period conditions.  Unfortunately, in a number of cas
es, the only available data base for a given land 
use category or loading parameter represented a relatively small and limited data collection process. 

These studies were carefully examined on a case-by-case basis and a decision was made as to 

whether or not to include the data in loading rate
 estimates.  No studies with less than five storm 
sample events were used.  An important requirement
 for inclusion of stormwater monitoring data is 
that the study measures only a homogeneous watershe
d area.  This requirement is necessary since 
input into most loading rate models is based upon homogeneous land use types.  Unfortunately, this 

requirement limited the usefulness of several 
thorough stormwater studi
es by the USGS which 
evaluated mixed land use areas.   

 

 Approximately 120 reports and publications of
 stormwater research conducted within the 
State of Florida were initially reviewed as a part 
of the literature search process.  During the initial 
review process, studies which contain an insuffi
cient number of sample events or address mixed 
land use areas were removed from further consid
eration, leaving approximately 40 reports with 
potential  pollutant loading information. 

 

 The Harper (1994) report includes all signi
ficant stormwater characterization studies 
performed in Florida prior to the early 1990s. 
 However, a limited number of additional runoff 
characterization studies have been performed 
since the publication date for this report.  
Therefore, a supplemental literature search 
was performed by ERD to identify additional 
resources for characterization data.  Additional land use characterization studies were obtained 

for single-family  residential  areas,  low-inte
nsity  commercial, highway/transportation land use, 
agriculture-citrus, agriculture-row crop, and ope
n space/undeveloped/rangeland/forest areas. 
The supplemental characterization data were comb
ined with the data provided by Harper (1994) 
to generate a database reflecting all significant ch
aracterization studies performed in Florida.  A 
brief summary of information contained within
 selected characterization studies from the 
combined database is given in Table 4-3. A lis
ting of hydrologic and general characteristics for 
studies included in the combined database is given in Appendix B.

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

 A large number of stormwater monitoring studi
es have been conducted within the State of 
Florida as part of the NPDES Program.  Stormwater
 samples collected as part of this program are 
restricted to a well defined range of rainfall de
pths and antecedent dry period conditions.  Although 
this information may be useful in comparing runoff characteristics between major metropolitan 

areas, the sampling protocols required by this progr
am do not necessarily provide accurate estimates 
of the average annual runoff concentrations for a 
given pollutant discharging from various land use 
categories.  These values can only be estimated 
by monitoring a wide range of rainfall depths and 
antecedent dry period conditions.  As a result, data 
collected as part of th
e NPDES Program are not 
utilized to estimate runoff characteristics for the purposes of this evaluation. 

 

 Studies included in development of stormwater
 characterization data cover the period from 
1977-2005.  Runoff concentrations of many parameters
 appear to be relatively consistent for a 
particular land use over this period with the excepti
on of lead.  Concentrations of lead in studies 
conducted prior to 1980-1990 are generally much 
greater than post 1980-1990 studies, presumably 
due to reductions of lead content in gasoline 
over this same period. Recent research conducted by 
ERD indicates that concentrations of total l
ead in stormwater runoff measured since 1990 are 
substantially lower than values measured prio
r to 1990.  Therefore, it is assumed that lead 
concentrations presented in pre-1990 studies are not
 representative of current conditions and are not 
included in estimation of mean runoff characteristics of lead. 

 

 In general, the objective of the literature re
view is to provide estimates of event mean 
concentrations (emc) for each study included in th
e stormwater characterization database.  When 
applied on an annual basis, the event mean concentration is defined as follows: 
 
 
 
In essence, this value reflects a flow-weighted 
average concentration for a given parameter over 
an annual cycle.  When the emc is multiplied by the estimated total annual runoff volume, it 

provides an estimate of the annual mass loadi
ng discharging from the evaluated land use 
category for a given pollutant. 
 

 
4.1.2 Single-FamilyResidential
 
 
 Single-family residential land use is define
d as a typical detached home with lot sizes 
generally less than 1 acre and dwelling densities gr
eater than 1 dwelling unit per acre.  Duplexes 
constructed on one-third to one-half acre lots are al
so included in this category.   This type of 
land use is characterized by a moderate degree of impervious area, generally ranging from 

approximately 20-40%. Hydrologic characteristics 
for the identified single-family residential 
stormwater characterization studies are given in
 Table B.1 (Appendix B).  Watershed areas for 
the identified characterization studies range fr
om 7.39-897 acres, with impervious percentages 
ranging from 6.1-65.0%.

 A summary of mean stormwater characteristic
s from single-family residential stormwater 
studies is given in Table 4-4.  Each of the studi
es included in Table 4-4 provide characterization 
data for total nitrogen and total phosphorus.  However, nutrient concentrations measured at the 

Orlando Duplex site by Harper (1988) appear to 
be substantially elevated, particularly when 
compared with total phosphorus values measured at
 the remaining sites.  The measured emc of 
1.69 mg/l for total phosphorus at this site is a clear
 outlier in the data set and is not included in 
estimation of the mean emc values for total phosphorus.  The total nitrogen emc of 4.62 mg/l at 

this site also appears to be elevated but is not
 a clear outlier value.  Therefore, this value is 
retained for estimation of the mean emc for tota
l nitrogen.  Total nitrogen emc values range from 
1.02-4.62 mg/l, with an overall mean of 2.07 mg/l.
  Total phosphorus emc values range from 
0.102-0.510 mg/l, with an overall mean of 0.327 mg/l. 
 All but one of the listed studies provides 
characterization data for BOD, with 13 of the 17 studies including information for TSS.

 Heavy metal characterization data from the residential land use studies is relatively 

limited, with the greatest amount of data availabl
e for copper, lead, and zinc.  However, as 
discussed in Section 4.1.1, lead concentrations
 measured prior to 1990 are excluded from 
estimation of overall mean concentrations, substantially reducing the available data set for this 

parameter. 

 

 As seen in Table B.1, five of the 17 stor
mwater characterization sites utilize grassed 
swales exclusively for conveyance of stormwat
er runoff, while seven of the stormwater 
characterization sites use curb and gutter systems exclusively.  The remaining sites use a 

combination of swale and curb and gutter system
s.  A comparison of runoff characteristics for 
residential sites utilizing grassed swales and curb/
gutter drainage systems is given in Table 4-5.  
With the exception of total phosphorus, runoff char
acteristics collected from residential areas 
utilizing grassed swales appear to be subs
tantially lower in value than observed for 
characterization sites utilizing curb and gutter syst
ems.  Overall, runoff collected from grassed 
swale drainage systems was approximately 38% lo
wer for concentrations of total nitrogen, 48% 
lower for BOD, 46% lower for TSS, 47% lower fo
r copper, and 23% lower for zinc than mean 
values measured at monitoring sites which utilized curb and gutter systems. 

 

 An analysis of variance comparison was 
conducted between the two data sets to 
determine if the observed differences in runo
ff concentrations between grassed swales and 
curb/gutter sites are statistically significant.  
This analysis was conducted only for total nitrogen, 
total phosphorus, BOD, TSS, copper, and zinc due to the limited data sets available for the other 

parameters.  None of the differences in concen
trations were found to 
be significant at a 95% 
probability level.  However, the observed differen
ces in total nitrogen concentrations were found 
to be statistically different at a 91% probability 
level, with a 77% probability level for significant 
differences in BOD concentrations, a 86% proba
bility level for significant differences in TSS 
concentrations, and a 75% probability level for si
gnificant differences in copper concentrations. 
However, the overall number of data points available for this analysis is limited which makes 

detection of significant differences between the data sets more difficult.

4.1.3 Multi-FamilyResidential
 
 
 Multi-family residential land use consists 
primarily of apartments, condominiums, and 
cluster homes.  In general, this land use contai
ns a large degree of impervious surface, with 
impervious percentages often in excess of 50%.  
A summary of hydrologic parameters from the six 
identified multi-family residential stormwater ch
aracterization studies is given in Table B.2. 
Watershed areas for the selected studies range 
from 8.7-73.3 acres, with impervious percentages 
ranging from 61-74%.  Each of these monitoring sites utilizes underground stormsewer systems. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
4-15 
 

 
 A summary of mean stormwater emc values from multi-family residential stormwater 

studies is given in Table 4-6.  E
ach of the six listed studies provides characterization data for total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus, with five of the 
studies also providing information on BOD and 
TSS.  Information on heavy metals is extremel
y limited for this land use category, with mean 
values provided only for copper, lead, and zinc. 
 Studies performed prio
r to 1990 are not included 
in estimation of mean values for lead concentrations. 

 

 In general, mean concentrations for tota
l nitrogen, total phosphorus, BOD, and TSS from 
the multi-family studies are higher in concentra
tion than mean values obtained from the single-
family residential studies.  The increases in 
runoff characteristics observed in multi-family 
residential areas are expected due to the larger 
degree of impervious area and the higher level of 
activity.

4.1.4 Low-Density Residential (Rural)
 
 
 Low-density residential land use is defined 
as a rural type community with lot sizes 
generally greater than one acre and less than one 
dwelling unit per acre.  These areas are typically 
characterized by low traffic volum
es and runoff coefficients along with relatively low pollutant 
loading rates.  The majority of these land areas
 are pervious surfaces covered by grass or wooded 
areas with only a small percentage of impervious area. 

 

 Low-density rural residential land use is 
the only general land use category for which 
specific loading rate studies were not found during th
e literature search.  However, this type of land 
use is basically a mixture of the categories of
 single-family residential and open space since 
vegetated areas in the low-density category are of
ten left in a natural condition typical of open 
spaces.  Therefore, for purposes of this evaluati
on, runoff characteristics for low-density residential 
areas are estimated as the arithmetic mean of the m
ean values for single family residential (Table 4-4 
and open space (Table 4-12).   

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

4.1.5 Low-Intensity Commercial Areas
 
 

 For the purposes of this evaluation, the term 
intensity refers to the level of use of the 
commercial area rather than an indication of the t
ype of business or density of development.  Low-
intensity commercial areas are defined as areas 
which receive only a moderate amount of traffic 
volume and where cars may be parked during the day for extended periods of time.  Since most 

commercial activities themselves generate relatively 
little pollutant loading, the majority of pollutant 
deposition occurs as a result of automobiles and trucks operating within the commercial area.  Low-

intensity commercial areas include schools, church
es, professional office sites, and small shopping 
centers.  High-intensity commercial areas include
 downtown business districts and large regional 
shopping areas. 

 

 A summary of hydrologic characteristics fr
om low-intensity commercial stormwater 
characterization studies is given in Table B.3.  Nine
 separate studies were identified in the available 
literature, with watershed areas ranging from 2.17-
50.70 acres.  Percentage imperviousness for the 
commercial sites range from 60% to approximately 
100%.  Eight of the nine studies utilize curb and 
gutter stormsewer systems, with swales utilized 
for drainage conveyance at the Florida Aquarium 
site. 

 

 A summary of mean stormwater emc values
 from low-intensity commercial stormwater 
studies is given in Table 4-7.  
Characterization data for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and TSS are 
provided for each of the nine studi
es, with eight of the nine studies providing characterization data 
for BOD.  As observed in previous land use categor
ies, characterization data for heavy metals is 
somewhat limited.  In general, low-intensity co
mmercial areas are characterized by relatively low 
levels of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and B
OD, although TSS concentrations are somewhat 
elevated.  Runoff characteristics reported by Harper
 and Herr (1993) are not included in calculation 
of the mean value since the runoff in this study r
eceived pre-treatment in a vegetated swale prior to 
collection.

4.1.6 High-Intensity Commercial Areas
 
 
 High-intensity commercial land use consists of commercial areas with high traffic volume 

and relatively constant traffic moving into and out 
of the area.  For purposes of this evaluation, high-
intensity commercial areas include downtown busine
ss districts and large regional shopping areas. 
This land use category is typically characterized 
by a high degree of imperviousness, with values 
often in excess of 90%. 

 

 A summary of hydrologic characteristics from 
high-intensity commercial stormwater studies 
in Florida is given in Table B.4.  Watershed sizes
 for the characterization studies range from 28-83 
acres, with impervious percentages ranging from 
96.4-98%.  Four separate studies were obtained 
from the literature search which includes a re
gional shopping mall, a downtown commercial area, 
and commercial areas with heavy traffic volume. 

 

 A summary of mean stormwater emc values from high-intensity commercial stormwater 

studies is given in Table 4-8.  
Each of the four studies provides characterization data for total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus, while only half of th
e studies provide characterization data for BOD 
and TSS.  Each of the studies also provides char
acterization information for lead and zinc, although 
all of the studies which provide data for lead 
were performed prior to 1990 and not useful for 
estimating current lead characteristics in runoff.  As
 seen in Table 4-8,  runoff characteristics from 
high-intensity commercial areas are substantially hi
gher for virtually all evaluated parameters than 
observed in the low-density commercial studies.

es could be identified which specified industrial 
park land use.  Two of these studies were performed during the 1980s, with the final study 

performed during 2002.

 A summary of hydrologic characteristics from th
e industrial stormwater studies is given in 
Table B.5.  Watershed area and percent impervious
 area are not available 
for two of the three 
studies, with only impervious percentage provided for the final study.   

 

 A summary of emc values from industrial land us
e areas is given in Table 4-9.  In general, 
industrial areas are characterized by relatively low 
concentrations of total nitrogen and BOD, with 
more elevated concentrations of total phosphorus and TSS.

4.1.8 Highway/Transportation
 
 
 Highway/transportation land use consists prim
arily of major highway systems, such as 
interstate highways, expressways, and major stat
e and federal highway systems.  In general, 
highway systems included under this category are cons
idered to be heavily traveled, with constant 
traffic movement throughout the day.  This land us
e category is typically characterized by a high 
degree of imperviousness. 

 

 A summa ry of hydrologic information fr
om highway/transportation stormwater 
characterization studies is given in Table B.6.  Elev
en  runoff characterization studies were identified 
in the literature review, with watershed areas ranging from 1.3-58.3 acres and impervious 

percentages ranging from 36-100%.  Approximately half
 of the studies represent interstate highway 
systems, with the remaining studies reflecting majo
r 4- or 6-lane highways.  All of the systems 
provide drainage by curb and gutter systems. 

 

 A summary of emc values from highway/transpor
tation stormwater studies is given in Table 
4-10.  Each of the 11 studies provides information 
for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, with five 
studies providing information for BOD and eight
 studies providing information for TSS.  A 
relatively large number of the studies also in
cluded measurements of heavy metals, including 
cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, nickel, lead, a
nd zinc.  In general, highway/ transportation 
stormwater appears to have moderate levels of
 total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and TSS, with a 
relatively low level for BOD.  Stormwater concentra
tions of copper and zinc appear to be somewhat 
elevated compared with concentrations measured in other land use categories.

 The mean stormwater characteristics summari
zed in Table 4-10 are intended for use only 
where highway/transportation is the dominant land use 
category in a particular area.  As indicated 
previously, stormwater characteristics summarized
 in this table are most appropriate for 
expressways, interstate highway systems, and heavily
 traveled roadways.  Roadways associated with 
other land use categories, such as residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture, open space, and 

mining/extractive, are included in the stormwat
er characteristics presented for each of these 
categories.  Therefore, roadway areas for these 
land use types should not be evaluated separately 
since runoff generated on the roadway surfaces is 
mixed with runoff generated from the dominant 
land use category. 
 

 
4.1.9 AgriculturalAreas
 
 
 Agricultural land use within Florida is extr
emely varied, both in terms of agricultural 
activities and soil types.  Agricultural activities su
ch as cattle grazing and row crops are commonly 
conducted on poorly drained soils which are charact
erized by a relatively high runoff potential.  
Citrus, however, requires well drained soils with a 
much lower runoff potential than those typically 
associated with grazing or row crop activities.  For 
these reasons, a wide range of  agricultural uses 
and characteristics must be considered to obtain re
presentative emc values appropriate for specific 
agricultural activities.  For purposes of this analysis
, agricultural activities in Florida are divided into 
three primary categories, including pasture land, c
itrus, and row crops.  Su
fficient characterization 
data currently exists within the literature to provi
de separate runoff characteristics for each of these 
three categories.

4.1.9.1  Pasture Land Use
 
 
 Three separate studies were identified in the literature review which provide runoff 

characterization data for pasture land use.  A 
summary of hydrologic characteristics from these 
pasture land use studies is given in Table B.7.  Wa
tershed sizes for the evaluated areas range from 
21.6-155,741 acres.  Each of the three study sites occurred on relatively poorly drained soils. 

 

 A summary of emc values from pasture land 
use studies is given in Table 4-11.  Runoff 
characterization data is provided in each of the 
three studies for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, 
with BOD and TSS provided in two of the th
ree studies.  Measurement of heavy metal 
concentrations was not conducted in any of the studies
.  In general, pasture land use appears to have 
runoff concentrations for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and TSS which are substantially greater 

than concentrations observed in residential or commercial areas.

A relatively large degree of variability appears 
to exist between runoff concentrations from 
the three pasture land use areas.  These differences 
are particularly apparent in the measured runoff 
concentrations for total nitrogen, total phosphorus
, and TSS in the St. Cloud study.  The studies 
performed in the St. Johns River Basin and in 
Ash Slough present hydrologic and water quality data 
at the farm boundaries after transport through conveyance systems to the point of discharge from the 

farm.  These measured values reflect the effect
s of pollutant uptake and attenuation during travel 
through conveyance systems such as canals or on-site detention ponds.  This type of value is more 

representative of runoff characteristics which actually discharge from large farm basin areas.  
 

However, the St. Cloud study represents water qua
lity data measured directly as runoff from 
the field area prior to entering adjacent canals and d
itches and, as a result, does not include pollutant 
uptake and deposition of suspended solids and nutrien
ts within conveyance systems located within 
the farm.  As a result, the total nitrogen, total phos
phorus, and TSS values obtained at this site are 
substantially greater than those obtained at the other sites.  Nevertheless, this value is included in 

estimation of mean values for pasture land use to
 account for pasture areas that discharge rapidly 
into off-site drainage systems.

4.1.9.2  Citrus Land Use
 
 
Seven runoff characterization st
udies involving citrus land use were identified during the 
literature review.  Soil types represented in th
ese studies are generally poorly drained soils, 
consisting of fine grain sands, peat, or muck.  The wa
ter table elevations in most of these studies was 
controlled by furrows and lateral ditches to keep th
e root zone of the plants dry.  A summary of 
hydrologic characteristics from the citrus land use studies is given in Table B.8.  Watershed sizes 

included in the land use characterization studies
 range from 184-56,868 acres. Studies included in 
this category were conducted from 1987-1997. 
 

A summary of emc values from the citrus land 
use studies is given in Table 4-12.  Each of 
the seven studies provides characterization data 
for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, with two 
studies providing data for BOD, a
nd five studies providing studies for TSS.  Information on heavy 
metal characteristics from citrus land uses is extremely limited. In ge ne ra l , c i t rus l a nd use  a ppea rs 

to have moderate concentrations for total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus, with relatively low 
concentrations for BOD, TSS, and heavy metals.

4.1.9.3  Row Crops Land Use
  
 
 Eight separate studies were identified in the literature which provide stormwater 

characterization data for row crop activities.  
A summary of hydrologic characteristics from row 
crop stormwater studies in Florida is given in
 Table B.9.  Watershed areas included in these 
studies range from 12-5680 acres, although half of 
the sites did not include information on the 
watershed area.  Soil types included in the areas
 are a combination of sand and muck soils.  
Studies included for characterization of
 row crops were performe d from 1987-2002.

 A summa ry of emc values from row crop st
ormwater studies is given in Table 4-13.  
Each of the eight studies provide characteriza
tion data for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, 
with five of the studies providing informati
on for TSS, and none of the studies providing 
information for BOD.  Information on heavy metal characteristics is included in three of the 

eight studies.  In general, nutrient concentrations 
measured in row crop areas appear to be similar 
to those observed in pasture land use areas, a
lthough measured TSS concentrations in row crop 
areas appear to be substantially lower than those observed in pasture areas.

4.1.9.4  Comparison of Agricultural Characteristics
 
 
 A comparison of emc values from pasture, 
citrus, and row crop agricultural activities is 
given in Table 4-14.  Pasture land use appears to 
have the largest mean concentration for total 
nitrogen, total phosphorus, and TSS.  The lowest concen
trations for these parameters occur for citrus 
land use.  

 

 A category of general agriculture is also included in the final row of Table 4-14.  This 

category simply reflects the arithmetic mean of the listed characteristics for pasture, citrus, and row 

crop activities and is intended as a generic represen
tation of agricultural activities for use in studies 
where information on specific agricultural activities is not known.

4.1.10 Undeveloped/Rangeland/Forest Land Use
 
 
 The category of undeveloped/rangeland/fo
rest land use includes open spaces and 
undeveloped land occupied by native vegetation, forests, and rangeland.  These areas are typically 

characterized by little or no impervious area and 
a relatively low runoff potential throughout most 
of the year. 

 

 Five separate runoff characterization studies
 were identified which measured undeveloped, 
rangeland, or forest land use areas.  A summary of 
hydrologic characteristics from these studies is 
given in Table B.10.  The evaluated studies ra
nge from Tallahassee to Miami.  However, 
information on watershed area is not provided for a
ny of the studies since delineation of watersheds 
for natural areas is often difficult.  Land use in
 the evaluated studies includes flatwood, rangeland, 
open spaces, and forests, and studies were conducted over the years from 1977-2004. 

 

 A summary of emc values from the undevel
oped, rangeland, and forest stormwater studies 
is given in Table 4-15.  Each of the five studies provides characterization data for total nitrogen and 

total phosphorus, with three studies providing data 
for BOD, and four studi
es providing data for 
TSS.  Heavy metal characteristics for copper, l
ead, and zinc are included in only one study.  In 
general, undeveloped, rangeland, and forest la
nd uses are characterized by relatively low 
concentrations for each of the available parameters summarized in Table 4-15.

4.1.11 Mining/Extractive Land Use
 
 
 The category of mining/extractive land use in
cludes a wide variety of mining activities for 
resources such as phosphate, sand, gravel, clay, and sh
ell.  Very little informa
tion is available in the 
current literature concerning the runoff characteristics of this land use type with the exception of 

site-specific studies generated as a result of wate
r quality violations and enforcement actions.  The 
only reference which provides runoff characteriza
tion data for mining/extractive land use is the 
Boggy Creek Study by the East Central Florida 
Regional Planning Council (ECFRPC) in 1988. 
This study assumes that very little pollution is 
generated from the actual mining operation, and 
runoff characteristics primarily reflect contributions
 from access roads, parking areas, and office 
sites.  This assumption appears reasonable for many types of mining activities which generally 

extract materials from isolated pit areas.  A su
mmary of hydrologic data from the ECFRPC study is 
given in Table B.11.  Although the wa
tershed size is not presented in the study, the percentage of 
impervious area is estimated to be 23%. 

 

 A summary of stormwater emc values from 
mining/extractive land use studies is given in 
Table 4-16.  Information is provided in the B
oggy Creek study only for total nitrogen and total 
phosphorus, with a mean total nitrogen concentr
ation of 1.18 mg/l and a mean total phosphorus 
concentration of 0.15 mg/l.

4.1.12 Wetlands
 
 
 Land uses assigned to the category of wetla
nds include a wide range of diverse wetland 
types, such as hardwood wetlands, cypress 
stands, grassed wetlands, and mixed wetland 
associations.  Wetland systems are routinely in
cluded in ongoing monitoring efforts, and wetland 
characterization data is available throughout the St
ate of Florida for a variety of wetland types. 
 

 When wetland characterization data is required, 
it is best to obtain regionally-specific data 
for the type of wetland system being evaluate
d.  Wetland characterization is available through 
STORET, water management districts, FDEP, and local governmental monitoring agencies. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
4-25 
 

 
 The hydrology of wetlands can be extremely 
complex, varying from flow-through wetlands 
which discharge throughout much of the year
, to depressional wetlands which discharge 
infrequently.  When including wetlands in pollu
tant loading evaluations, the site-specific 
hydrologic characteristics of the wetlands under evalua
tion must be considered.  As a result of the 
complexities of wetland systems, guidelines c
oncerning representative concentrations and 
hydrologic characteristics of wetlands are not included in this analysis. 

 

 
4.1.13 OpenWater/Lakes
 
 
 The final land use category, open water/lakes, c
onsists of open waterbodies such as lakes, 
reservoirs, streams, and rivers.  Pollutant con
centrations from these sources are a result of 
discharges from the waterbody during and follo
wing rain events.  The discharge from the 
waterbody is a mixture of runoff contributed 
from the surrounding watershed and the ambient 
water quality characteristics of the waterbody.  Wate
rbodies often provide pollutant attenuation for 
watershed areas which are tributary to the waterbody. 

 

 Characterization data is currently availabl
e for a large number of waterbodies located 
within the State of Florida.  These data ar
e easily available through STORET, the LAKEWATCH 
Program at the University of Florida, water ma
nagement districts, FDEP, and local governmental 
agencies.  In many cases, specific water quality data
 may be available for larger waterbodies which 
may be included in a pollutant loading analysis.  
Due to the abundant availability of site-specific 
data, recommendations on representative water quality characteristics for open water/lake land uses 

are not provided in this analysis. 
 

 
4.1.14 Recommended Characterization Data
 
 
 A summary of literature-based runoff character
ization data for general land use categories 
in Florida is given in Table 4-17 based upon the info
rmation provided in the previous sections.  The 
values summarized in this table represent the m
ean emc values for each of the general land use 
categories discussed previously. 

 

 In general, the data summarized in Tabl
e 4-17 reflect a pattern of increasing runoff 
concentrations with increasing land use intensity. 
 Of the three types of residential land uses 
summarized in Table 4-17, the lowest emc values ar
e associated with low-density residential. 
Increases in emc values occur when the land use inte
nsity is increased to single-family residential, 
and further increases occur as the intensity is 
increased to multi-family.  A similar pattern is 
apparent between low- and high-intensity commerc
ial areas, with higher emc values reflected for 
high-intensity commercial areas for each of the listed parameters.  Land use categories which are 

not expected to be a significant source of nitroge
n or phosphorus loadings, such as industrial and 
highway areas, are characterized by relatively low con
centrations for these parameters.  In contrast, 
agricultural areas, which would be expected to ha
ve elevated concentrations of nutrients, are 
characterized by higher concentrations of nutrients, particularly for total phosphorus.

 The mean runoff characteristics summarized 
in Table 4-17 are recommended for use in 
general runoff characterization and loading studies w
ithin the State of Florida.  However, in areas 
where more site-specific runoff characterization in
formation is available, the site-specifi c data 
should be used instead of the generalized data summarized in Table 4-17. 

  

 

 Several assumptions were made in assigni
ng runoff concentrations to provide a more 
complete database for the general land use categorie
s.  First, runoff characterization data was not 
available for copper, lead, or zinc in low-density 
residential land uses in the literature.  Therefore, 
to provide estimates of runoff characteristics for th
ese parameters, typical concentrations of copper, 
lead, and zinc in low-density residential areas are 
assumed to be equal to 50% of the mean values 
listed for single-family residential.  Heavy metal c
oncentrations were also not available for copper, 
lead, or zinc for mining/extractive land uses.  
As a result, runoff concentrations for these 
parameters in mining/extractive areas are assumed 
to be similar to concentrations observed in 
industrial areas.  Pollutant contributions from 
mining activities are generated primarily from the 
movement of trucks and automobiles along access roads into and out of the site, as well as parking 

lots and garages.  These activities are very similar to those occurring in industrial areas.

4.2  Estimation of Runoff Quantities
 
 
 Estimates of annual and event-based runoff volum
es were calculated to evaluate variability 
in regional runoff generation and the performance e
fficiencies of dry retention systems.  These 
calculations were performed using the SCS 
(Soil Conservation Service) Curve Number 
Methodology and the historical rainfa
ll data sets for meteorological sites discussed in Section 4.1. 
A discussion of the methodology and results of this modeling is given in the following sections. 

 

 
4.2.1 Methodology
 
 
 The SCS curve number methodology utilizes se
parate calculations for the runoff volume 
generated from directly connected impervious ar
eas (DCIA) and non-DCIA areas.  An impervious 
area is considered to be directly connected if r
unoff from the area flows dir
ectly into the drainage 
conveyance system, such as a gutter or stormsewer
.  Areas are also considered to be directly 
connected if runoff from the area occurs as a con
centrated shallow flow that is conveyed through a 
pervious area, such as a roadside swale, and th
en into a drainage system.  The SCS curve number 
method assumes that after allotting for initial abstraction, all rainfall which occurs on directly 

connected impervious areas becomes stormwater runoff. 

 

 Non-directly connected impervious areas 
(non-DCIA) include all pervious areas and 
portions of impervious areas which are not consid
ered to be directly connected.  The SCS model 
assumes that runoff generated in these areas has th
e opportunity to infiltrate into the soil, depending 
upon the soil types and land cover characteristics, be
fore significant runoff volumes begin to be 
generated within the area.  The runoff generati
ng characteristics of non-DCIA areas are quantified 
through the use of a curve number (CN).  A curve 
number is a hydrologic factor which is used to 
reflect the runoff potential of a particular land us
e and soil type.  Theoretical values for curve 
numbers range from 0-100, with low values refl
ecting a low runoff potential and higher values 
reflecting a high runoff potential.  Representative cu
rve numbers can be obtained from a variety of 
sources,  although  the  original  source  of  these 
 data  was  published  by  the  Natural  Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS) as Technical Release 55 titled ﬁUrban Hydrology for Small 

Watershedsﬂ dated June 1986.  This reference provi
des an extensive listing of curve numbers for 
different hydrologic soil groups and land use covers. 

 

 The TR 55 document divides soil groups with
in the United States into Hydrologic Soil 
Groups (HSG) which groups general soil types with 
respect to runoff-producing characteristics.  A 
summary of the characteristics of the designated 
hydrologic soil groups, identified as A, B, C, and 
D, is given in Table 4-18.   The primary consid
eration in assigning soils to the general soil group 
types is the inherent capacity of the bare soil to
 permit infiltration.  Soils classified in HSG A 
consist primarily of deep sandy soils, with a high infiltration rate and a low runoff potential.  The 

vast majority of rainfall which occurs in these ar
eas is absorbed by infiltration and does not become 
stormwater runoff.  Soils classified in HSG D c
onsist of clayey-type soils or soils with a high 
organic content which exhibit a low infiltration ra
te and a high runoff potential.  A large portion of 
the rainfall which occurs on soils in this classification ultimately becomes stormwater runoff.

 The SCS method calculates the runoff volum
e for a given rainfall event by adding the 
rainfall excess (runoff) from the non-DCIA portion 
to the rainfall excess created from the DCIA 
portion of the land use.  Rainfall excess from
 the non-DCIA areas is calculated using the 
following set of equations:

 For the DCIA portion, rainfall excess is calculated using the following equation: 

 
Whe n P
i
 is less than 0.1, Q 
DCIAi
 is equal to zero.  This factor refl ects the initial abstraction for the 
impervious areas which assumes that the first 0.1 inch
 of rainfall is stored w
ithin the irregularities in 
the impervious surfaces and does not become stormwat
er runoff.  After these surfaces become filled 
with the initial 0.1 inch of rainfall, additional rain
fall begins to generate runoff on these surfaces. 
 

 One of the primary objectives of the hydrol
ogic modeling efforts conducted by ERD is to 
evaluate the impact of the variability in probability
 distributions of individual rain events throughout 
the State of Florida, as discussed in Section 
3.2, on rainfall/runoff relationships, as characterized by 
variabilities in modeled runoff coefficients.  The imp
acts of variability in the 
sizes of individual rain 
events can best be evaluated using a conti
nuous simulation hydrologic model which evaluates 
rainfall/runoff relationships over an extended period 
of time.  However, this type of continuous 
modeling cannot be adequately conducted using ra
infall data summarized on a daily basis.  A 
portion of the 111 NCDC meteorological stations 
within the State of Florida also provide 
precipitation records which are summarized on an hourly basis.  A listing of NCDC hourly 

precipitation monitoring stations in Florida is gi
ven in Table 4-19.  Hourly precipitation data is 
available from 45 separate monitoring stations, w
ith a period of hourly rainfall data ranging from 13-
64 years. 

 

 All available hourly precipitation data was obt
ained for each of the 45 monitoring stations 
listed in Table 4-19.  For each site, a conti
nuous simulation was conducted of rainfall/runoff 
relationships using the entire record
 of hourly precipitation data for each site based on the SCS curve 
number method.  This modeling included a mean of
 approximately 4685 individual rain events for 
each of the 45 monitoring stations.  A location map for the 45 hourly precipitation monitoring sites is 

given on Figure 4-1. 

 

 The pervious area curve number values listed 
in engineering texts and reference manuals, 
used to estimate the amount of runoff lost due to inf
iltration into the soil during a  rain event, reflect 
a ﬁnormalﬂ antecedent moisture condition at the time 
of the rain event.  These curve number values 
are commonly used for modeling design storm events
 (25- or 100-year storms) for developed areas 
where soil infiltration is a relatively insignifi can
t loss in comparison with the overall volume of 
runoff generated during these design storm even
ts.  However, when performing continuous 
simulation modeling, the soil moisture condition at th
e time of the rain event can have a significant 
impact on the runoff volume generated from pervi
ous areas.  The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) 
has developed three antecedent soil moisture c
onditions to account for variability in runoff 
generation as a function of antecedent rainfall c
onditions.  These three antecedent soil moisture 
conditions are labeled I, II, and III and are identified as follows:

 The antecedent rainfall necessary to trigger AM
C I or III conditions is based upon the rate at 
which the soil storage is recovered following a rain ev
ent.  Loss of soil moisture occurs as a result of 
several processes, one of which is evapotrans
piration.  Evapotranspiration increases during the 
ﬁgrowingﬂ season and decreases during the ﬁdormantﬂ season.  For Florida, the growing season is 

commonly assumed to be from March-September, and the dormant season from October-February. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
4-32 
 

 
 Recommended rainfall depths corresponding to 
the three antecedent moisture conditions 
(AMC) are summarized in Table 4-20 (USDA,
 1986) for both dormant
 and growing season 
conditions.  Antecedent moisture conditions are 
determined by evaluating the total cumulative 
rainfall in the 5-day period prior to a selected 
rainfall event.  During dormant season conditions, 
occurring from October-February, a cumulative ant
ecedent 5-day rainfall less than 0.5 inches would 
indicate a shift to antecedent mois
ture Condition I for the new rain event.  During growing season 
conditions, this value increases to 1.4 inches.  Howe
ver, if the total antecedent 5-day rainfall exceeds 
1.1 inches during dormant season conditions, an antecedent moisture Condition III is assigned to the 

next rain event.  Under growing season conditi
ons, this value increases to 2.1 inches.  When 
performing continuous simulations, the SCS reco
mmends that the standard curve number value 
assumed for modeling purposes be modified to consider antecedent rainfall conditions.

 Estimates of runoff depths were generated fo
r each of the 45 hourly meteorological sites for 
a wide variety of directly connected impervious
 area (DCIA) and non-DCIA
 curve numbers.  Runoff 
calculations were performed for combinations 
of DCIA values ranging from 0-100%, in 5% 
increments, and for non-DCIA curve numbers ranging from 30-95, in 5-unit increments, along with 

a non-DCIA curve number of 98.  The calculated r
unoff depth for each combination of DCIA and 
non-DCIA curve number represents the total 
runoff generated for the assumed hydrologic 
characteristics over the entire period of record for a gi
ven site.  The total runoff depth is then divided 
by the total rainfall depth which occurred over the entire period of record to generate a runoff C 

value for each combination of DCIA and curve number. 

 

 The runoff coefficient ranges 
from 0-1 and represents the ratio of runoff depth to the 
precipitation depth.  The rated C Value is calculated using the following equation: 

 

 
C Value =
 
Generated Runoff (depth or volume)
 
Total Rainfall (depth or volume)
 
 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
4-34 
 

 
Runoff C values can be calculated on either an even
t basis or for an annual period.  The calculated C 
value for each combination of DCIA and curve numbe
r reflects the average runoff/rainfall ratio for a 
given meteorological monitoring site over the entir
e available period of record.  The calculated 
runoff C value does not represent anticipated rain
fall/runoff relationships for any given year, but 
does reflect anticipated runoff/rainfall relationships over an extended period of time for each site.   

 

 
4.2.2 Impacts of Rainfall Distributions on Runoff Depth
 
 
 The variability in fr equency distributions of i
ndividual rain events, discussed in the previous 
section, has the potential to impact rainfall/runoff rela
tionships for individual rain events as well as 
on an annual basis.  Areas which have a large num
ber of small rain events which generate little 
measurable runoff may have a lower annual runoff 
coefficient than a similar area in a different 
portion of the State which is char
acterized by a high frequency of large rain events which generate 
significant runoff. 

 

 The potential impacts of rainfall frequency di
stributions on runoff volumes were evaluated 
by conducting simulations of the annual runoff 
depth generated by typical residential and 
commercial developments constructed at various locations throughout the State.  Eight separate 

undeveloped and developed land use categories were 
assumed to evaluate the impacts of rainfall 
distributions on annual runoff coe
fficients.  A summary of hydrologic assumptions used for the 
developed land use categories is given in Table 4-
22.  The low-density residential areas are assumed 
to have approximately 15% impervious area, 
with 5% of the area as DCIA.  Hydrologic 
characteristics are provided for single-family residential developments based on 25% impervious 

and 40% impervious conditions.  High-density reside
ntial areas are assumed to be 65% impervious, 
with 80% impervious assumed for commercial activitie
s.  Curve numbers for pervious areas are also 
included based on soil types and assumptions rega
rding landscaped conditions.  Highway land use 
categories are also included, based upon 50% and 
75% impervious assumptions.  Curve number 
values for pervious areas are provided for each of the four major hydrologic soil groups. 
 

Estimates of the annual runoff depths genera
ted by the land use categories summarized in 
Table 4-22 were calculated using the continuous
 simulation methodology outlined in Section 4.2.1 
and the hydrologic characteristics summarized in Tabl
e 4-22.  These estimates were calculated for 
each of the 45 NCDC hourly precipitation monitori
ng stations summarized in Table 4-19.  This 
process resulted in a total of 1440 separate l
ong-term continuous simulations by modeling annual 
long-term runoff coefficients for each of the eight
 land use types, four individual soil groups, and 45 
monitoring stations.  The calculated runoff coeffici
ents for each combination of monitoring site, land 
use, and curve number reflect the average annual r
unoff coefficient for the modeled monitoring sites 
over the entire available period of record. 
 

The runoff C values generated as a result of th
e process outlined above were evaluated using 
a K-means clustering algorithm to identify similaritie
s and differences in a
nnual runoff coefficients 
for each of the eight land use types and four soil gr
oups across the State of Florida.  The clustering 
algorithm attempts to mi nimi ze the squared erro
r objective function, representing the distance 
measured between a data point and the center of a c
hosen cluster.  Clustering is simply a method of 
partitioning a data set into sub-sets (clusters) so that
 the data in each sub-set are statistically similar 
for the evaluated common trait.

 For this evaluation, cluster analysis was c
onducted for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 clusters.  There 
is no standard technique to determine the optimum
 number of clusters which should be chosen to 
represent a particular data set.  However, the 
elbow criterion is a common rule of thumb which is 
often used to determine the appropriate number of
 clusters to be selected.  The elbow criterion 
indicates that you should select a 
number of clusters so that adding an additional cluster does not 
provide a significant amount of additional informati
on in the model.  This criterion is typically 
evaluated using the percentage of variance expl
ained for each cluster model.  A graph of the 
percentage of variance and annual runoff coeffici
ents explained as a function of the number of 
clusters is given in Figure 4-2.  As the curve begi
ns to approach the 4- or 5-cluster models, the 
additional variance explained by adding an additiona
l cluster to the model becomes incrementally 
small.  Therefore, an appropriate number of cluste
rs for the annual runoff coefficients model appears 
to be approximately 4 or 5.  The 5-cluster analys
is was selected as the final model because this 
model identified the Florida Keys as unique in te
rms of annual runoff coefficients compared with 
other areas throughout the State of Florida.  
ERD has conducted stormwater and meteorological 
monitoring throughout the State of Florida, includi
ng the Florida Keys, and has firsthand knowledge 
of the substantially different meteorological processes which occur within the Florida Keys 

compared with other areas within the State of Florid
a.  As a result of this firsthand experience, the 5-
cluster model was selected.

 A graphical summary of the results of the 
cluster analysis is given in Figure 4-3. 
Meteorological monitoring sites with similar runo
ff generating characteristics are grouped together 
by color on this figure.  Approximate areas repr
esented by the clustered meteorological monitoring 
sites are shaded in similar colors, generally on a County-wide basis.  The majority of the indicated 

zones appear to be intuitive with respect to va
riability in rainfall events throughout the State. 
Portions of the Panhandle have been clustered t
ogether in an area which is impacted by a high 
number of large frontal events.  Portions of the St
ate along the Gulf Coast also appear to be similar 
runoff generating characteristics.  Central and Cent
ral-Coastal portions of Florida also appear to 
have similar runoff characteristics.  Runoff patterns 
in Southeast Florida appear to be dissimilar to 
rainfall patterns in other areas of the State.  The 
Florida Keys are also identified on Figure 4-3 as a 
unique meteorological zone.  The meteorological
 zones indicated on Figure 4-3 are utilized 
throughout the remainder of this report for eval
uating runoff generation, pollutant loadings, and 
stormwater management system performance.

 Unfortunately, not all counties in Florida have long-term meteorological monitoring sites 

with hourly data.  For purposes of designating me
teorological zones, counties without a monitoring 
site were grouped according to the meteorologi
cal characteristics of adjacent counties with 
monitoring sites.  The resulting zones appear to be
 relatively intuitive with respect to meteorological 
processes.  The cluster groupings only have tw
o apparent outliers, Daytona Beach and Tamiami 
Trail, which appear out of place.  However, in a 
data set containing 45 points, an analysis conducted 
at a 95% probability level would be expected to ha
ve approximately 2-3 outlier values.  A listing of 
counties included in each meteorological zone is given in Table 4-23.

4.2.3 Annual Runoff Generation
 
 
 A summary of calculated mean annual runoff coefficients as a function of curve number and 

DCIA is given in Appendix C for each of the five
 designated meteorological zones.  The values 
presented in these tables reflect the proportion of
 annual rainfall which becomes stormwater runoff 
in each meteorological zone for 315 DCIA and non-
DCIA curve number combinations.  Continuous 
simulations of runoff generation were conducted over 
the period of record for each of the 45 hourly 
meteorological monitoring stations in Florida.  R
unoff calculations were performed for combinations 
of DCIA values ranging from 0-100%, in 5% in
crements, and for non-DCIA curve numbers ranging 
from 30-95, in 5 unit increments.   A non-DCIA 
curve number of 98 was also included in this 
analysis.  The mean runoff C value for each co
mbination of DCIA and curve number value was 
calculated using values from each of the meteorol
ogical monitoring sites within a given zone.  The 
values summarized in Appendix C reflect the averag
e long-term runoff coefficients for each of the 
five designated zones over a wide range of DC
IA and curve number combinations.  The data 
summarized in Appendix C reflect a total of 14,175 
separate long-term continuous simulations of 
runoff coefficients based upon the 21 DCIA intervals, 15 curve number intervals, and 45 

meteorological monitoring sites.  This information is
 used in subsequent sections for evaluation of 
existing stormwater design criteria and to evaluate the performance efficiency of proposed 

alternative regulations. 

 

 The information contained in Appendix C can 
be used to estimate the annual runoff volume 
for a given parcel under either pre- or post-de
velopment conditions by multiplying the mean annual 
rainfall depth for the given area, obtained from th
e Figures in Appendix A.3, times the appropriate 
runoff coefficient based upon the DCIA and curv
e number characteristics for the meteorological 
zone in which the parcel is located, listed in Appendix C.  This estimate is calculated as follows: 

 

 
Annual Runoff Volume  (ac-ft) = 
 

Linear interpolation can be used to estimate annua
l runoff coefficients for combinations of DCIA 
and curve number which fall between the values included in Appendix C. 

 

 As seen in Appendix C, a wide degree of va
riability is present in calculated annual runoff 
coefficients for various combinations of DCIA
 and non-DCIA curve numbers between the five 
meteorological zones in Florida.  Increases in 
DCIA as well as increases
 in the non-DCIA curve 
number both result in significant increases in th
e calculated annual runoff coefficients.  To 
illustrate the general relative relationships 
between DCIA, curve number, and annual runoff 
volumes, a set of average annual runoff coeffi
cients was generated by calculating the mean 
runoff coefficient for each combination of DC
IA and non-DCIA curve number for the five 
meteorological zones in Florida.  A graphical su
mmary of this relationship is given in Figure 4-
4. This graph indicates a linear relationship between
 runoff coefficients and percent DCIA,  with 
an exponential relationship between runoff coeffi
cient and curve number.  Increases in curve 
numbers, particularly at curve number values in 
excess of 80, result in substantial increases in 
the estimated annual runoff coefficient and corresponding annual runoff volume.

A graphical illustration of the distribution of 
runoff coefficients as a function of DCIA 
and curve number for the Panhandle (Zone 1) rainfall 
distribution is given in Figure 4-5.   In this 
meteorological region, DCIA appears to have a re
latively small impact on runoff coefficient at 
DCIA percentages of 40 or less.  However, 
at percentages above 40, the runoff coefficient 
appears to increase rapidly.  Changes in curve number appear to have a minimal impact on 

runoff coefficients until the curve number begins 
to exceed approximately 85.  Above this value, 
subsequent increases in curve number result in large increases in runoff coefficient.

 A graphical representation of the distribution 
of runoff coefficients as a function of DCIA 
and curve number for the Florida Keys meteorologi
cal zone is given in Figure 4-6.  For this 
rainfall distribution, DCIA appears to have a re
latively minimal impact on runoff coefficients 
until the DCIA begins to exceed 
a value of approximately 70.  Above this value, subsequent 
increases in DCIA result in rela
tively large increases in runoff coefficients.  Changes in curve 
number appear to have a relatively small imp
act on runoff coefficient until the curve number 
begins to exceed a value of approximately 95.  A
bove this value, runoff coefficients begin to 
increase rapidly.  The data presented in Figure 
4-6 suggest that, for a given combination of 
DCIA and curve number, the runoff coefficient for the Florida Keys zone is substantially lower 

than the runoff coefficient which would occur in the Panhandle region. 
 

A graphical representation of the state-wide m
ean distribution of runoff coefficients as a 
function of DCIA and curve number 
is given in Figure 4-7.  This diagram represents the average 
of the five designated meteorological zones within 
the State.  On a state-wide basis, significant 
changes in runoff volume do not occur until th
e DCIA value exceeds approximately 45-50 and 
the curve number exceeds 90. 
 

For comparison purposes, modeled annual 
runoff coefficients for a hypothetical 
development with a DCIA of 40% and a non-DCIA
 curve number of 70 are given in Figure 4-8.  
If this development were to be constructed in the Florida Keys (Zone 3) or Central (Zone 2) 

portions of the State, approximately 36% of the 
annual rainfall would become stormwater runoff. 
However, if this development were to be c
onstructed in the Panhandle area, approximately 39-
40% of the annual rainfall would become stormw
ater runoff.  On a state-wide average, 
approximately 37.5% of the rainfall which o
ccurs on the hypothetical development would 
become stormwater runoff.  Lower than average 
annual runoff coefficients would be observed in 
the Florida Keys (Zone 3), Central Area (Zone 
2), and Gulf Coast Area (Zone 4), with higher 
runoff coefficients observed in the Panhandle (Zone 1) and Southeast Coastal (Zone 5). 
 

The differences in annual runoff coeffici
ents between the meteorological regions 
summarized in Figure 4-8 are due primarily to di
fferences in the distribution of rain events 
which occur at each of these sites.  For exampl
e, the Key West and Melbourne regional sites are 
characterized by a high percentage of annual even
ts with a relatively low rainfall depth which 
generate little or no measurable runoff volume.  
Since a large portion of the annual rainfall in 
these areas is generated by small events, the net 
effect is to substantially decrease the annual 
runoff coefficient associated with these areas. 
 On the other hand, the Pensacola and Tallahassee 
areas are characterized by a high percentage of 
larger storm events, commonly associated with 
frontal boundaries which move through the area.  Si
nce larger rain events typically generate a 
larger proportion of stormwater runoff than sma
ller events, the annual runoff coefficients for 
these areas tend to be more elevated. 
 

The results summarized in Figure 4-8 have si
gnifi cant implications with respect to the 
performance efficiency of stormwater manageme
nt systems, particularly systems that have 
design criteria based on providing tr
eatment for the runoff generated by a stated rainfall event. 
Based on the information summarized in Figure 4-8, a 1-inch rain event in the Panhandle area 

will generate more runoff than a 1-inch rain even
t which occurs in the Florida Keys or Central 
areas.  This would create a substantial difference,
 not only in the required treatment volume, but 
also in the performance efficiency of a stor
mwater system designed for the same hypothetical 
development in the Panhandle and Florida Keys.

 The phenomenon illustrated in Figure 4-8 is explained primarily by the relative number 

of small and large rain events associated with
 the different meteorological regions within the 
State.  For example, a comparison of the percen
tage of annual rainfall volume generated by rain 
events less than 0.1 inch at the designated meteor
ological regions is given in Figure 4-9.  For the 
Florida Keys (Zone 3) sites, approximately 5-8% of the annual rainfall volume is contributed by 

rain events less than 0.1 inch in depth.  Ba
sed upon the assumption that impervious surfaces 
provide an initial abstraction of approximate
ly 0.1 inch, no measurable runoff would be 
measured by rain events of this size.  In cont
rast, only approximately 3-6% of the annual rainfall 
volume in the Panhandle zone is contributed by rain events less than 0.1 inch in depth. 

 

 A comparison of the percentage of annual rainfall volume generated by rain events 

greater than 1 inch is given in Figure 4-10.  
Only approximately 49% of the annual rainfall 
volume which occurs in the Florida Keys (Zone 3)
 is generated by rain events greater than 1 
inch. However, at the Panhandle sites (Zone 1), approximately 62% of the annual rainfall volume 

occurs as a result of events greater than 1 
inch.  Since larger rain events generate a 
proportionately larger runoff volume due to the 
lessening impact of initial abstraction, areas 
which have a higher proportion of large rain even
ts can be expected to have a larger annual 
runoff coefficient.

A comparison of the percentage of annual rain
fall depth lost to abstraction on impervious 
surfaces for each of the meteorological zones is gi
ven in Figure 4-11.  In the Florida Keys (Zone 
3) area, approximately 21% of the total annual ra
infall which occurs on impervious surfaces is 
lost as a result of initial abstraction.  This 
rainfall, which is stored on the surface of the 
impervious areas, is removed by evaporation pro
cesses between storm events.  However, in the 
Panhandle (Zone 1) area, only 15% of the annual ra
infall depth is lost to initial abstraction on 
impervious surfaces due to the higher percentage of 
large rain events in this portion of the State.

SECTION  5 
 

 PERFORMANCE  EFFICIENCY  OF 
STORMWATER  MANAGEMENT  SYSTEMS
 
 
 
A substantial amount of research has been
 conducted over the past 20-25 years which 
demonstrates that some commonly used stormw
ater management techniques are much more 
efficient in removing and retaining pollutant loadi
ngs than others.  However, in spite of this 
research, many stormwater management facilities 
are selected or designed based upon the ability 
of the system to function hydraulically rather
 than with regards to pollutant removal 
effectiveness.  One of the primary objectives 
of this project is to evaluate stormwater 
management systems from a pollutant removal perspective and to make recommendations 

concerning the types of stormwater manageme
nt facilities which should be emphasized to 
maximize pollutant removal effectiveness while
 maintaining proper hydraulic function of the 
system. 

 

 This section provides an overview of the anticipated pollutant removal effectiveness of 

common stormwater management systems used within
 the State of Florida.  First, a literature 
review of previous research performed on t
ypical stormwater management systems within 
Florida is presented along with a summary of th
e pollutant removal effectiveness achieved by the 
evaluated studies.  Next, estimates of the polluta
nt removal effectiveness of common stormwater 
management systems are provided based upon curre
nt stormwater management design criteria 
within the State.  These estimates are based 
upon a combination of computer modeling and linear 
regression evaluations of relationships between
 performance efficiency and significant design 
parameters based on previous research. 

 

 The terms "detention" and "retention" are of
ten used interchangeably by engineers, even 
those who have been designing stormwater manage
ment facilities for many years.  For purposes of 
this evaluation, the following definitions shall apply: 
 

 
Detention
: The collection and temporary storage of stormwater, generally for a period 
of time ranging from 24-72 hours, in such a manner as to provide for 

treatment through physical, biological or chemical processes with 

subsequent gradual release of stormwater to downstream receiving waters. 
 

 

Retention
: On-site storage of stormwater with subsequent disposal by infiltration into 
the ground or evaporation in such a manner as to prevent direct discharge of 

stormwater runoff into receiving waters.

5.1 Literature-Based Removal Efficiencies
 
    forTypicalStormwaterTreatmentSystems
 
 
 A literature review was conducted of previous 
research performed in the State of Florida 
which quantifies pollutant removal efficiencies associated with various stormwater management 

systems used throughout the State.  Each study 
which was obtained was evaluated for adequacy 
of the database, with special attention to factor
s such as length of study, number of runoff events 
monitored, monitoring methodology, as well as comp
leteness and accuracy of the work.  It was 
preferred that selected studies contain at least 
a 3-month period of data collection, representing a 
wide range of rainfall and antecedent dry period conditions. 
 

Unfortunately, for a number of studies, the 
only available database for a particular 
stormwater management facility represented a relatively small and limited data collection 

process.  In other cases, the study evaluated only 
the outflow from the system and did not present 
sufficient information to estimate system performa
nce efficiency.  Some studies were identified 
which evaluated hybrid or experimental system
s which cannot be classified into a common 
stormwater system type associated with an existing design criteria.  All evaluated studies were 

carefully examined on a case-by-case basis and 
a decision was made on whether or not to 
include the data in the removal efficiency estimat
es.  In general, studies with less than five 
monitored storm events and studies which could 
not be classified into a common stormwater 
management practice were excluded.  Only stormw
ater management facilities constructed within 
the State of Florida were included in this eval
uation.  The resulting database contains pollutant 
removal efficiencies for the following types of common stormwater management facilities: 
 

1.   Dry retention   3.   Dry detention with filtration 

2.   Wet detention   4.   Off-line retention/detention (dual pond) 
 
A discussion of removal efficiencies for typical 
stormwater treatment systems is provided in the 
following sections. 
 
 

5.1.1 Dry Retention Systems
 
 
Dry retention systems consist primarily of in
filtration basins which are used to retain 
stormwater runoff on-site, thus reducing discha
rge to downstream waterbodies.  Disposal of 
stormwater runoff occurs by infiltration into th
e groundwater and, to a lesser degree, evaporation 
from the water surface during periods of standing 
water.  Because these systems rely primarily 
on infiltration of stormwater into the ground to re
gain the available pond storage, construction of 
these systems is limited to areas with low groundw
ater tables and permeable soils.  The soil and 
water table conditions must be such that the 
system can provide for 
a new volume of storage 
through percolation or evaporation within a 
specified period, generally 72 hours following the 
stormwater event. 
 

A schematic diagram of a typical dry reten
tion system is given in Figure 5-1.  This 
system is constructed as a dry basin with 
the pond bottom a minimum of 1-3 ft above the 
seasonal high groundwater table elevation, dependi
ng on applicable design criteria.  The pond is 
typically designed to hold a volume of stormwat
er, called the "treatment volume", which is 
equivalent to either the runoff generated by a sp
ecified rain event or a certain depth of runoff 
over the contributing watershed area.

Figure 5-1.  Schematic of a Dry Retention Facility. 
 

 

 

 

 

Dry retention ponds may be constructed as e
ither on-line or off-line systems.  Off-line 
systems typically provide storage for the treatme
nt volume only.  These systems typically utilize 
a weir structure to divert runoff into the re
tention pond until the treatment volume is reached. 
Runoff discharges in excess of the volume bypa
ss the pond and discharge into the detention 
portion of the system or directly off-site. 
 In an on-line system, the entire runoff volume 
discharges into the pond.  Runoff in excess of 
the treatment volume may discharge through an 
outfall structure. For on-line systems, an additi
onal volume may be provided above the treatment 
volume for peak attenuation of on-site discharg
es during major (10-year, 25-year, or 100-year) 
storm events.  The bottom of the pond is designed to
 be dry at all times except within 72 hours of 
the design storm event. 
 

Although retention ponds are most commonly cons
tructed as basins similar to Figure 5-1, 
retention pond designs can be highly variable as
 long as the system performs the desired 
infiltration function.  Retention ponds can be c
onstructed as linear pond areas along road right-
of-way, within recreational sites such as pl
aygrounds or athletic fields, within natural 
depressional areas, in open land, as part of the la
ndscaping for a commercial site, or as a shallow 
swale.  Dual use of facilities provides a met
hod for conserving valuable land resources while 
incorporating stormwater management systems into the on-site landscaping. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

As the stormwater runoff percolates thr
ough the soil, migrating toward the underlying 
groundwater, a variety of physical, chemical, a
nd biological processes occur which retain a 
majority of the stormwater pollutants in the uppe
r layers of the soil with
in the retention basin 
(Harper, 1985; Harper, 1988).  Previous re
search conducted by Harper (1985, 1988) has 
indicated that stormwater pollutants are trapped in
 relatively stable associations in the upper 4-6 
inches of soil within retention basins.  Con
centrations of nutrients and heavy metals in 
groundwater beneath dry retention basins are t
ypically lower in value than measured in 
stormwater runoff entering the retention system. 
 

Even though dry retention systems prevent di
rect discharge of stormwater runoff to 
receiving waterbodies, care must be taken in the 
design of retention facilities to ensure that 
significant underground migration of pollutants 
does not occur to adjacent surface waters.  
Pollutant loadings removed by the system may still reach adjacent receiving waters when 

retention basins are constructed immediately ad
jacent to the shoreline.  Lateral distances 
between retention ponds and surface water should be 
maintained as large as possible, at least 100 
ft or more, depending on the site conditions (FDEP, 1988).   
 

The side slopes and bottoms of dry retention 
basins should be fully vegetated with sod 
cover grown in sandy permeable soils.  Vegetation plays a crucial role in the removal of 

contaminants from stormwater and in stabilization 
of the soil.  The roots from vegetation assist 
in maintaining the permeability of the basin soils. 
 Bahia grass is typically used for sod cover 
since it is drought resistant and can withstand periods of inundation. 
 

In spite of the fact that on-line dry retention systems are used extensively throughout the 
State of Florida, relatively little research has b
een conducted to evaluate the pollutant removal 
effectiveness of these systems.  Only two references on dry retention systems were identified 

during the literature search, both of which were
 conducted as part of the Orlando Areawide 208 
Assessment during the late 1970s.  A summary of 
the treatment efficiencies for dry retention 
systems, based on available research studies in 
Florida, is given in Ta
ble 5-1.  The first study, 
published  in 1978 by the East Central Flor
ida Regional Planning Council (ECFRPC) was 
conducted on a commercial watershed in Orlando.  
Removal efficiencies for the dry retention 
system reported in this study ranged from approxi
mately 61% for total phosphorus to more than 
90% for species of nitrogen.  Info
rmation on the amount of retention storage available within this 
system was not provided so the removal efficiencies
 could not be related to a particular treatment 
volume. 
 

The second study, conducted by Wanielista 
(1978), was also part of the Orlando 
Areawide 208 Assessment.  This study presented estimated removal efficiencies for dry retention 

systems based upon simulations of yearly rain
fall/runoff events.  Removal efficiencies are 
presented as a function of retention volume, with 
increasing removal efficiencies associated with 
increasing runoff  volumes  retained.  This  simu
lation  assumes  that  the retention pond drains 
completely between rain events 
so that the design retention volume is available for the next 
storm event.  Removal efficienci
es of approximately 80% are associated with retention of 0.25 
inches of runoff, 90% for 0.5 inches of runoff, 
and 95% for a retention volume of 0.75 inches of 
runoff. These values have been used extensivel
y throughout the State of Florida as estimates of 
the performance efficiency of dry retention systems.

It is obvious that removal efficiencies ach
ieved in retention systems are regulated 
primarily by the amount of runoff volume retaine
d.  In general, the annual pollutant removal 
effectiveness of a retention system should increas
e as the retention volume increases.  Since dry 
retention systems do not always recover the en
tire pollution abatement volume before the next 
storm event, the actual observed pollutant removal 
efficiencies for dry retention systems are less 
than the theoretical values presented by Wani
elista.  The removal efficiencies proposed by 
Wanielista incorporate a first-flush effect whic
h assumes that a large portion of the pollutant 
loading occurs in the initial por
tion of the runoff volume, increasing the theoretical removal 
efficiencies achieved by retention of a specified
 runoff depth.  However,
 in many watersheds, 
significant first-flush effects do not occur, and ther
efore, removal efficiencies will not be as high 
as reported in the Wanielista study.  Subsequent 
research has suggested that first-flush effects 
occur primarily on relatively small watersheds (< 
10 acres) with a high percentage of DCIA.  In 
large watersheds with a low or moderate DCIA 
percentage, significant first-flush effects may not 
occur. 
 

As development intensity increases, so doe
s the volume of runoff from a given storm 
event.  For example, a 1-inch storm event 
on a rural residential development may produce 0.2 
inches of runoff while the same storm event 
at a commercial site may produce 0.6 inches of 
runoff.  To achieve similar pollutant removal e
fficiencies, a larger retention treatment volume 
would be required for the commercial site than the 
rural residential site.  Therefore, the treatment 
volume alone cannot be directly correlated to the 
pollutant removal efficiency of the stormwater 
treatment system.  Instead, the achievable pollutant
 removal efficiencies are directly related to 
the development intensity and the specified treatme
nt volume.  This concept will be discussed in 
detail in Section 5.2.  With dry retention treatment systems, the mass pollutant removal 

efficiencies are directly related to the volume of
 runoff retained as a percent of the total runoff 
volume produced.

5.1.2 Wet Detention Systems
 
 
Wet detention systems are currently a very
 popular stormwater management technique 
throughout the State of Florida, particularly 
in areas with high groundw
ater tables.  A wet 
detention pond is simply a modified detention f
acility which is designed to include a permanent 
pool of water.  These permanently wet ponds ar
e designed to slowly release collected runoff 
through  an  outlet structure.  A schematic diagra
m of a wet detention system is given in Figure 
5-2. 
 

 
 
 
 
Figure 5-2.  Schematic of a Wet Detention System. 
 
 

 

 

Pollutant removal processes in wet dete
ntion systems occur through a variety of 
mechanisms, including physical processes such as
 sedimentation, chemical processes such as 
precipitation and adsorption, and biological uptake fr
om algae, bacteria, and rooted vegetation. 
In essence, these systems operate similar to a natural lake system. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
5-7 
 

 
The water level in a wet detention system is 
controlled by an orifice located in the outfall 
structure from the pond.  A treatme
nt volume above the orifice invert elevation is calculated for 
each facility based upon a specified depth of runo
ff over the contributing drainage basin area. 
Inputs of stormwater runoff equa
l to or less than the treatment volume leave the facility through 
an orifice in the outfall structure, percola
tion into the surrounding groundwater table, or by 
evaporation.  Stormwater inputs into the facility 
in excess of the treatment volume can exit from 
the facility directly over a weir included in the pond outfall structure.  The weir is designed to 

provide attenuation for peak storm events so that
 the post-development rate of discharge from 
the facility does not exceed the pre-development ra
te of discharge for a specified design storm, 
typically a 25-year storm event.  A littoral zone
 may be planted around the perimeter of a wet 
detention facility to provide additional biological uptake and enhanced biological communities.  
 

Upon entering a wet detention facility, stormwater inputs mix with existing water 
contained in the permanent pool.  Physical, chem
ical, and biological pro
cesses begin to rapidly 
remove pollutant inputs from the water column. 
 Water which leaves through the orifice in the 
outfall structure is a combination of the mixture 
of stormwater and the water contained within 
the permanent pool.  In general, the concentra
tion of constituents in the permanent pool are 
typically much less than input concentrations in stormwater runoff, resulting in discharges from 

the facility which are substantially lower in con
centration than found in raw stormwater.  As a 
result, good removal efficiencies are achieved 
within a wet detention facility for most 
stormwater constituents.  Although the littoral 
zone provides a small amount of enhanced 
biological uptake, previous research has indicated
 that a vast majority of removal processes 
occurring in wet detention facilities occur within 
the permanent pool volume rather than in the 
littoral zone vegetation for the treatment volume 
(Harper, 1985; Harper 1988; Harper and Herr, 
1993).   
 

Wet detention systems offer several advantag
es over some other stormwater management 
systems.  First, wet detention systems provide relatively good removal of stormwater 

constituents since physical, chemical, and biological
 mechanisms are all available for pollutant 
attenuation.  Other stormwater management fac
ilities provide only one or two of these basic 
removal methods for stormwater.  A second adva
ntage of wet detention systems is that the 
systems are not complex and can be relatively eas
ily maintained.  Wet detention systems do not 
have underdrain systems which can become cl
ogged and need periodic maintenance.  Wet 
detention systems can be viewed as amenities in development projects. 
 

Of the stormwater facilities investigated 
during this evaluation, probably the most 
amount of research within the State of Florida has been conducted on wet detention systems. 

Unfortunately, much of the existing research
 was conducted on wet detention systems which 
were not constructed to current design st
andards regarding mean detention time, pond 
configuration, and depth.  The majority of th
e available studies do not present information 
regarding the treatment volume or residence time 
within the wet detention system.  However, 
based on the relative pond area and volume for the various studies, it appears that the typical 

residence time provided in the evaluated ponds is approximately 15 days or less.

A summary of treatment efficiencies for 
wet detention systems based on selected 
research studies in Florida is given in Ta
ble 5-2.  Measured removal efficiencies for 
orthophosphorus, total phosphorus, TSS, and heavy me
tals are relatively consistent between the 
studies presented within the table.  In contrast
, a high degree of variability in measured removal 
efficiencies is present for total nitrogen.  Rem
oval efficiencies for total nitrogen range from 12-
63% for the studies presented in Table 5-2.  
Wet detention systems provide mean removal 
efficiencies of approximately 60-65% for to
tal phosphorus, BOD, and copper, while removal 
efficiencies for orthophosphorus, TSS, lea
d, and zinc approach or exceed 75-85%.

In many of the studies, the ability of the sy
stem to remove total nitrogen was heavily 
dependent upon the proportion of total nitrogen pres
ent as organic nitrogen.  Organic nitrogen is 
not readily available, either biologically or ch
emically, and there are relatively few mechanisms 
for removal of this species in a wet 
detention system.  In contrast, both NO
x
 and NH
3
 are readily 
taken up in biological processes which accounts 
for the relatively good removal efficiencies 
achieved for these species in wet detention ponds. 
 In systems where organic nitrogen represents 
the dominant portion of the total nitrogen in the incoming stormwater flow, removal of total 

nitrogen can be expected to be relativ
ely poor.  If inorganic species of NO
x
 and NH
3
 represent 
the dominant nitrogen species found, then removal efficiencies for total nitrogen can be expected 

to increase.  On an average basis, wet detenti
on systems with a detention time of 14 days can be 
expected to provide a net removal of approxima
tely 20-40% for total nitrogen; 60-70% for total 
phosphorus and copper; and 75-85% or more for TSS, total lead and total zinc. 
 

The report by Harper and Herr (1993) presents
 separate removal efficiencies for pond 
residence times of approximately 7 days, along with
 detention times of 14 days or more.  With 
the exception of TSS, increasing the pond detenti
on time results in a slight improvement in 
removal efficiencies for the listed parameters.  
At a detention time of 7 days, removal of total 
nitrogen, total phosphorus and TSS is estimated
 to be approximately 20%, 50%, and 85%, 
respectively.   At a detention time of 14 days
, removal of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and 
TSS increase slightly to approximately 30%, 70%, and 85%, respectively. Little additional 

improvement in removal efficiencies was observe
d for most parameters at detention times in 
excess of 14 days up to the maximum detention time of 41 days included in the study. 
 

The report by Ruston, et al. (1995) summarizes 
pollutant removal efficiencies achieved 
within a wet detention pond in Tampa which recei
ves stormwater runoff from a light commercial 
area.  Pollutant removal efficiencies are provi
ded for pond detention times of 2, 5, and 14 days.  
In general, pollutant removal efficiencies obtaine
d at a detention time of 2 days are lower than 
removal efficiencies obtained at a detention tim
e of 14 days for all evaluated parameters.  
However,  the lowest removal efficiencies in th
e study were obtained at the 5-day detention time. 
Rushton, et al. reports that the lower efficien
cies observed during the 5-day detention time study 
period were highly influenced by one extreme st
orm event where almost 6 inches of rain 
occurred during a single week. 

 

 The most recent study to evaluate impacts 
of residence time on performance efficiency 
was conducted by DB Environmental (2005).  Th
is study was performed on a wet detention pond 
in Melbourne where portions of the pond were is
olated to create microcosms to simulate 
residence times of 1, 7, and 14 days.  In general, removal efficiencies for all of the evaluated 

parameters increased with increases in deten
tion time within the microcosms.  The removal 
efficiencies achieved at the 14-day residence tim
e are similar to values reported by Harper and 
Herr (1993), also for a 14-day residence time.

5.1.3 Dry Detention (With and
 
Without Filtration/Underdrains)
 
 
Historically, dry detention facilities have 
been one of the most common stormwater 
management techniques used throughout the State of
 Florida, particularly in South Florida. 
These systems are typically utilized in hi
gh groundwater table areas where the normal 
groundwater level makes the use of a retention type
 facility less feasible.  Dry detention systems 
are intended to be dry basins which are designed 
to hold a specific quantity
 of stormwater runoff 
(treatment volume).  Recovery of the design  treatme
nt  volume  occurs  as  a result of migration 
of the stormwater runoff through the pond bottom, 
discharge through an outfall orifice structure, 
or into an underdrain system or
 side bank filter constructed around the perimeter or bottom of the 
pond. 
 

A  schematic  diagram of a dry detention sy
stem (with underdrain) is provided in Figure 
5-3.  The underdrain system is typically used to
 control the existing groundwater table elevation 
in the vicinity of the pond and to improve the r
ecovery rate of the pollution abatement volume. 
Dry detention ponds are also constructed with side bank filters which perform a similar function.

Dry detention systems (without filtration) ha
ve been used commonly within the South 
Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) 
and the Southwest Florida Water Management 
District (SWFWMD).  In the St. Johns Rive
r Water Management District (SJRWMD), dry 
detention is limited to projects less than 5 acres
 in size or where the ground water table or soil 
conditions limit the feasibility of other BMPs.  
Dry detention systems utilize an orifice or V-
notch to slowly discharge the specified treatment volume following a storm event.   
 

Physical processes such as sedimentation, a
nd chemical processes such as precipitation 
and adsorption, are the primary mechanisms respons
ible for pollutant removal in dry detention 
with underdrain systems.  Stormwater inputs into
 these systems are typically evacuated within 
24-72 hours, and as a result, biological processes 
such as uptake of nutrients by plant surfaces 
and roots, are severely limited and do not play a 
significant role in the removal of stormwater 
pollutants.  Removal of particulate pollutant
s by sedimentation within the pond, as well as 
entrapment of particles within 
the filter system or soils during migration toward the underdrain 
system, are the primary physical removal processe
s in dry detention with filtration systems. 
Removal of particulate forms of phosphorus 
and heavy metals may also occur due to 
sedimentation through the pond. These systems have an extremely limited ability to remove 

dissolved constituents, most of which are best removed through biological processes. 
 

Many dry detention systems which utilize underdrains are constructed in a manner which 
requires the stormwater to migrate through on-site
 soil prior to entering the underdrain system. 
This design technique probably enhances the rem
oval efficiencies achieved by these systems due 
to the natural adsorption capacity of soils.  
Other designs pass the runoff through sand filer 
media prior to discharge.  However, the ability of common silica sand filter systems to remove 

dissolved constituents is severely limited (Harper and Herr, 1993).   
 

As seen in Figure 5-3, the underdrain and f
ilter systems associated with dry detention 
facilities are sometimes constructed to intercept 
and control the existing groundwater elevations 
in the vicinity of the basin to maintain a dr
y pond bottom.  This causes an influx of on-site 
groundwater into the underdrain system, resulting in a continuous flow from the system which is 

unrelated to rain events.  This continuous fl
ow of groundwater may actually create a system 
where substantially more mass leaves the stormwat
er facility on an annual basis than enters the 
system through stormwater runoff. 
 

However, it is possible for dry detention syst
ems to provide good removal efficiencies for 
total nitrogen, total phosphorus, TSS, and BOD.  
This can be accomplished by ensuring that the 
seasonal high groundwater table is one or mo
re feet below the proposed pond bottom and 
underdrain elevation.  The separation between
 pond bottom and seasonal high groundwater table 
elevation allows the pond to function as a dry re
tention pond system for some rain events.  One-
hundred percent removal is achieved for all r
unoff infiltrated through the pond bottom which is 
not intercepted by the underdrain system.  Pollu
tant removal efficiencies for dry detention 
systems can also be improved by removing the underdrain filter system, and replacing the filter 

system with a drawdown V-notch or orifice similar to a wet detention system. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

As previously discussed, the pollutant remova
l effectiveness of dry detention systems are 
largely affected by the elevation of the underd
rain system and pond bottom in relation to the 
seasonal high groundwater table.  This is evident in
 the literature-based treatment efficiencies for 
the dry detention systems, provide
d in Table 5-3, based on selected research studies performed in 
Florida.   Each of these systems is constructed 
with a side bank filter sy
stem for drawdown of the 
treatment volume. The first entry in Table 5-3 
contains removal efficiencies from research 
conducted at the Publix shopping center dry 
detention pond in Bradfordville, north of 
Tallahassee. Overall mass removal efficiencies greater than 80% were achieved for total 

nitrogen, total phosphorus, TSS, and BOD.  These 
high mass removal efficiencies were observed 
since 66% of the runoff entering the pond infiltrat
ed through the pond bottom.  Only 34% of the 
runoff which entered the pond discharged through the underdrain system or the overflow 

structure.  This pond functioned much differently
 than typical dry detention with filtration 
systems in other areas of Florida.

Conversely, the second entry in Table 
5-3 summarizes a study conducted on a dry 
detention pond in Orange County, FL.  The underdra
in for this pond was constructed several feet 
below the average groundwater table elev
ation surrounding the pond.  For this reason, 
groundwater continually flowed from the su
rrounding area into the underdrain system and 
directly into the adjacent receiving waterbody.  
The excess groundwater discharge resulted in a 
net export of total nitrogen, orthophosphorus, to
tal phosphorus, and BOD for this treatment 
facility. 
 

Based on the research performed on dry dete
ntion with filtration and dry detention 
systems, it is apparent that a majority of the 
mass removal effi ciencies are due to infiltration 
through the pond bottom and not due to removal 
processes occurring within the treatment 
facilities.  Ponds with bottoms  constructed a
bove the seasonal high groundwater table elevation 
will exhibit higher mass pollutant removal efficien
cies than ponds constructed into the seasonal 
high groundwater table.   

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
5-13 
 

 
Maximum removal efficiencies for a dry detention system could be achieved using a 
design which incorporates infiltration through 
the pond bottom and forces the remaining inputs 
into the underdrain system to pass through the 
filter media, while maintaining an underdrain 
elevation at least 1 ft above the seasonal high 
groundwater table.  This system would utilize 
infiltration and filtration as the primary removal mechanisms. 
 

It appears that annual mass removal efficienci
es for dry detention with filtration systems 
are highly variable.  However, in order to provide
 comparative pollutant removal efficiencies for 
common stormwater management systems, theo
retical pollutant removal efficiencies are 
assumed for dry detention with filtration syst
ems based upon the assumption that 25% of the 
annual runoff volume which enters the pond infiltr
ates through the pond bottom.  The estimated 
mass removal efficiencies for a dry detention w
ith filtration system, based upon this assumption, 
is estimated to be approximately 30% for tota
l nitrogen, 40% for total phosphorus, 90% for TSS, 
and 50% for BOD.  These removal efficiencies ma
y improve slightly if the treatment volume is 
increased beyond the standard design.  Since th
e primary removal mechanism is the physical 
process of sedimentation of particles, the in
creased detention time provided by the additional 
treatment volume has the potential to increase sy
stem efficiency.  However, most of the 
settleable solids should be removed very quickly
 and little additional removal may occur at the 
extended detention time. 
 

 
5.1.4 Off-lineRetention/Detention
 
(Dual Pond) Systems
 
 
Off-line retention/detention systems provide an off-line retention pond for the treatment 
volume and an on-line detention pond for flood cont
rol and attenuation of peak discharges.  A 
diversion device, often called a "smart box", is used
 to divert first-flush stormwater runoff into 
the retention pond.  When the retention pond fills, 
the remaining stormwater runoff is diverted 
directly to a detention pond for flow attenuation purposes. 
 

A schematic diagram of an off-line retention/
detention system is given in Figure 5-4. 
Volume recovery in the retention portion of 
the system occurs primarily through groundwater 
infiltration and evaporation.  Drawdown in the detention pond occurs through an outlet structure 

designed to match pre- and post-development di
scharge rates.  Off- line retention/detention 
systems have been used sporadically throughout
 Florida, although these systems are required 
within the City of Orlando.  Even though this type
 of system requires two ponds rather than one, 
the required ponds are typically much smaller in size than a single pond, and can be placed into a 

development landscape more easily than a singl
e large system, minimizing potential impacts on 
space requirements.   
 

Off-line retention/detention systems provide pollutant removal mechanisms in both the 
retention system as well as the detention portion 
of the pond.  Stormwater runoff retained in the 
retention system infiltrates through the gr
ound with 100% removal efficiency.  Removal 
processes such as settling, adsorption, and precipita
tion reactions occur in the detention facility 
during the drawdown period and al
so provide similar mass removal efficiencies to the dry 
detention system.

A summary of treatment efficiencies for o
ff-line retention/detention systems based on 
studies conducted within the State of Florida is gi
ven in Table 5-4.  Only two studies have been 
conducted in the State of Florida which provide
 pollutant removal efficiencies for off-line 
retention/detention systems.  Each of thes
e studies was conducted by Harper (1988) in the 
Orlando area on residential and commercial watershe
ds, constructed within the City of Orlando, 
which provided a treatment volume of 0.5 inches over the contributing watershed area. 
 

Excellent removal efficiencies were achieve
d in the study reported by Harper (1988) in 
the Orlando residential watershed.  Measured removal efficiencies for total nitrogen, total 

phosphorus, TSS, BOD, total copper, and total zinc were equal to 85% or more.  Removal 

efficiencies measured in the commercial wate
rshed studies are somewhat lower than those 
reported in the residential watershed.  Removal 
efficiencies for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, 
TSS, and BOD measured in this study were 30%, 76%, 89%, and 64%, respectively.  
 

Mean values for the two studies are reported 
at the bottom of Table 5-4.  On an average 
basis, off-line retention/detention facilities provi
de excellent removal efficiencies for total 
nitrogen, total phosphorus, TSS, BOD, and heavy metals.  Annual removal efficiencies for this 

type of system can be expected to be approximately 60-65% for total nitrogen and total copper; 

75-85% for total phosphorus and total lead; and 80-90% for TSS, BOD, and total zinc.

5.1.5 Comparison of Treatment Efficiencies
 
for Typical Stormwater Management Systems
 
 
A comparison of treatment efficiencies for t
ypical stormwater management systems used 
in the State of Florida is gi
ven in Table 5-5 based upon information provided in the literature 
review.  Comparative removal efficiencies are 
provided for dry retention, wet detention, and dry 
detention.  For the purposes of the evaluation, rete
ntion is considered any method of infiltrating 
water into the ground.  This includes traditional re
tention ponds, stormwater reuse, swales, or the 
use of exfiltration trenches.

Of the three basic stormwater treatment syst
ems, retention provides the highest level of 
treatment possible.  All stormwater runoff retain
ed or infiltrated into 
the ground is assumed to 
have a 100% mass pollutant removal efficiency for th
e retained volume.  This is the best possible 
stormwater treatment system to use in terms of pollutant removal efficiency.  Mass removal 

efficiencies for wet detention have been divi
ded into 7-day and 14-day detention times, with 
mass removal efficiencies ranging from 20-30% 
for total nitrogen, 60-70% for total phosphorus, 
85% for TSS, and 50-60% for BOD.  Estimated 
mass removal efficiencies for dry detention 
systems are 0-30% for total nitrogen, 0-40% fo
r total phosphorus, 90% for TSS, and 0-50% for 
BOD, depending on the relationship between the pond bottom or underdrain and the 

groundwater table elevation.  These removal effi
ciencies are based upon anticipated settling of 
TSS within the pond and the range of listed polluta
nts present in a particulate form.  Based on 
the information provided in Table 5-5, the most 
effective stormwater management system in 
terms of retaining stormwater pollutants is 
dry retention, followed by wet detention, and dry 
detention systems.   
 
 
   5.2PerformanceEfficiencyofExisting
 
    StormwaterDesignCriteria
 
 
 The literature review presented in the previous
 section provides estimates of the performance 
efficiency of stormwater management systems wh
ich have been evaluated within the State of 
Florida.  However, each of these studies reflects 
relatively site-specific performance efficiency data 
based upon the specific design of the stormwat
er management facility and the regional 
meteorological characteristics in the vicinity of th
e study site.  Since meteorological characteristics 
and design criteria for stormwater management syst
ems vary widely throughout the State of Florida, 
performance efficiency data for a stormwater mana
gement system constructed in one part of the 
state may not be applicable to similar stormwater 
management systems constructed in other parts of 
the State. 

 

 Evaluations were conducted as part of this ev
aluation to provide estimates of the anticipated 
performance efficiencies of stormwater management
 systems within the State of Florida considering 
variations in design criteria and meteorological ch
aracteristics throughout the State.  These analyses 
are then used to compare the anticipated performa
nce efficiency of stormwater management systems 
constructed according to current design criteria w
ith the overall performance efficiency objectives 
outlined in the Water Resource Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40 FAC).   

 

 
5.2.1 DryRetention
 
 
 As discussed in Section 2, design criteria for dry retention systems within the State of Florida 

are based upon providing treatment for a volume equivale
nt to a certain depth 
of runoff, typically 0.5 
inch, over the project area, or the runoff generated fr
om a specified rain event, typically 1 inch.   
Estimates of the annual mass removal efficiencies a
ssociated with these design criteria are discussed 
in the following sections. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
5-17 
 

 
 
5.2.1.1  Evaluation Methodology
 
 
 The anticipated annual mass removal efficiencies achieved by dry retention systems were 

valuated for each of the five meteorological z
ones over a wide range of DCIA percentages and 
non-DCIA curve numbers.  These evaluations we
re conducted using a continuous simulation of 
runoff volumes generated on a hypothe
tical 1 acre site using the historical rainfall data sets for 
meteorological sites in each of the five zone
s.  This analysis was performed for DCIA 
percentages ranging from 0-100 in 5-unit inte
rvals and for non-DCIA curve numbers ranging 
from 30-95 in 5-unit intervals, along with 
a non-DCIA curve number of 98, comprising 315 
combinations of DCIA percentages and non-DCIA curve numbers. 

 

 The runoff generated by individual rain ev
ents was calculated using the continuous 
simulation methodology outlined in Section 4.2.1.  
This methodology was used to estimate the 
runoff volume generated by individual rain events 
within the historical rainfall records.  The 
runoff generated by the rain event was instantane
ously routed into a theoretical dry retention 
pond with a treatment volume equivalent to a sp
ecified depth of runoff or the runoff from a 
specified rain event.  A hypothetical drawdow
n curve was established for the retention pond 
based upon typical drawdown design 
criteria which require recovery of 50% of the treatment 
volume in 24 hours and 100% of the treatment 
volume in 72 hours.  If the runoff volume 
exceeded the capacity of the retention pond, th
e remaining volume was assumed to bypass the 
pond directly with a treatment efficiency of 0.  
Each storm within the historical record was 
routed through the theoretical retention pond with excess runoff assumed to bypass the system. 

 

 The evaluation methodology used to estimate th
e performance efficiency of dry retention 
systems is based upon the following assumption: 

 
 

Watershed areas contributing to each stormwater management facility do not exhibit 

first-flush effects with respect to runo
ff concentrations.  Although small, highly 
impervious watershed areas, typically less than 
5-10 acres in size, may exhibit first- flush 
effects under certain conditions, there is no scien
tific evidence to indicate that larger sub-
basin areas exhibit a first-flush effect on a 
continuous basis.  Therefore, the analyses 
presented in this report may be somewhat c
onservative for small basins which exhibit a 
first-flush effect.  
 
 
For this analysis, it is assumed that the 
calculated performance efficiency of a dry 
retention stormwater management system is base
d entirely upon the percentage of water retained 
during each storm event.  For a dry retention system, it is assumed that a pollutant removal 

efficiency of 100% is achieved for the entire treatme
nt volume retained within
  the  system.  As a 
result, removal efficiencies of 100% are achieve
d for all rainfall events which generate runoff 
volumes less than or equal to the available tr
eatment volume within the pond.  Rainfall events 
which generate runoff in excess of the ava
ilable volume are assumed to have a removal 
efficiency of 100% for all generated runoff up to the available treatment volume, with a removal 

efficiency of 0% for runoff inputs in excess of the treatment volume.   

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
5-18 
 

 
Pollutant removal effi ciencies were calculated for selected dry retention treatment 
volumes for each meteorological zone and each of
 the 315 combinations of DCIA and non-DCIA 
curve number listed previously based upon the assumptions outlined in the previous paragraphs. 

 Removal efficiencies were calculated  for  re
tention  treatment  volumes  ranging  from  0.25 
inch to  4.0 inches of  runoff  
in 0.25-inch increments.  Removal efficiencies were also calculated 
for retention volumes based on the runoff from
 a specified rainfall depth ranging from 0.25-4.0 
inches in 0.25-inch increments. 
 

 
 
5.2.1.2  Design Criteria Based on Runoff Depth
 
 
 Estimates of annual mass removal efficiencies 
for dry retention as a function of selected 
runoff depths, DCIA percentages, and non-DCIA
 curve numbers are given in Appendix D for 
each of the five meteorological zones.  In genera
l, the annual removal efficiency of a retention 
pond increases as the retention depth increases.  
Also, treatment efficiency decreases as the 
DCIA percentage and non-DCIA curve number incr
ease.  The removal efficiencies summarized 
in these tables are valid for all stormwater 
constituents since the efficiencies are based upon 
retention of a specific runoff volume within the 
retention pond.  As a result, the stated removal 
efficiencies are assumed to be valid for all st
ormwater constituents, including total nitrogen, total 
phosphorus, TSS, and BOD. 

 

 A common design requirement for dry retention systems is a retention treatment volume 

of 0.5 inch of runoff or 1.25 inches
 of runoff from the impervious area, whichever is greater. 
Based on this criteria, projects with 40% imperv
ious area or less will be required to provide 
retention for 0.5 inch of runoff, while projects with impervious percentages in excess of 40% 

will be regulated by 1.25 inch of runoff from the impervious area. 

 

 A summary of calculated annual mass removal efficiencies for a dry retention pond with 

a treatment volume equivalent to 0.5-inch of runo
ff is given in Table 5-6 for each of the five 
meteorological zones over a wide range of DCIA percentages and non-DCIA curve numbers.  In 

general, annual mass removal efficiencies of 
80% or more, as required the Water Resource 
Implementation  Rule  (Chapter  62-40 FAC), are 
obtained with a treatment volume equivalent to 
0.5 inches of runoff only for projects with lo
w percentage DCIA and low non-DCIA curve 
number values.  On a state-wide average, a rem
oval efficiency of 80% can only be achieved at 
DCIA percentages of 25-35% or less and non-DC
IA curve numbers of approximately 45-55 or 
less.  An example of a development which woul
d meet these characteristics is a single-family 
residential community constructed on HSG A soils
 with grass cover in fair to good condition. 
All developments with DCIA percentages a
nd non-DCIA curve numbers in excess of these 
values will fail to meet the 80% removal criteri
on with a retention treatment volume equivalent 
to 0.5 inch of runoff. 

 

 A graphical comparison of estimated annua
l pollutant removal efficiencies obtained 
using 0.5 inch of dry retention in a hypothetical 
development with a DCIA percentage of 40% 
and a non-DCIA curve number of 70 is given in 
Figure 5-5.  Annual removal efficiencies range 
from approximately 58-69% between the five mete
orological zones.  The lowest annual removal 
efficiencies would be obtained 
in the Panhandle area, with the highest annual removal pollutant 
efficiencies achieved in the Central areas.

Figure 5-5.   Calculated Annual Mass Removal E

a Development with 40% DCIA and a non-DCIA Curve Number of 70. 
 

 

 

Isopleths for state-wide average removal effi
ciencies using 0.5 inch of dry retention for 
various DCIA percentages and non-DCIA curve 
numbers are illustrated on Figure 5-6 based on 
the combined data set for the 45 meteorological st
ations with hourly precipitation data.  At low 
values for DCIA and non-DCIA curve numbers, rem
oval efficiencies approach or exceed 80%. 
However, as the DCIA percentage and non-DCIA 
curve number increase, the removal efficiency 
for 0.5 inch of dry retention decreases rapidly. 

 

 For projects with impervious percentages in
 excess of 40%, the retention design criterion 
within the St., Johns River (for off-line system) and South Florida Water Management Districts 

becomes 1.25 inch of runoff from the impervious area.  For a project with an impervious 

percentage of 80%, which is near the upper e
nd of impervious coverage allowed under most 
zoning regulations, the required retention depth would be: 

 
 
 
Retention Depth  = 1.25 inches  x  0.8  =  1.00 inch

Calculated annual mass removal efficiencies
 for a dry retention pond with a treatment 
volume equivalent to 1 inch of runoff are al
so listed in Appendix D.  Assuming that the 
impervious area is 100% directly connected, the 
estimated annual mass removal efficiencies for 
this system are provided for each of the five meteorological zones in the column designated 80% 

DCIA.  In general, the highest estimated annual mass removal efficiencies would occur on a 

project site with a low non-DCIA curve numbe
r, while the lowest anticipated annual mass 
removal efficiencies would occur in a system 
constructed with a high non-DCIA curve number.  
Estimated annual mass removal efficiencies for a tr
eatment system with 1 inch of retention range 
from approximately 67.2-75.9% depending upon the pa
rticular meteorological region within the 
State.  The highest estimated annual removal effi
ciencies appear to occur in the central and 
coastal areas, with the lowest annual mass removal 
efficiencies occurring in the southeast coastal 
and panhandle areas of the State. 

 

 In summary, with the exception of projects 
constructed on highly permeable soils with 
low impervious percentages, current design crite
ria based on retention of the first 0.5-inch of 
runoff or 1.25 inches from the impervious area 
fail to meet the target annual mass pollutant 
removal efficiency of 80% for stormwater mana
gement systems outlined in the Water Resource 
Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40 FAC).  A
nnual mass removal efficiencies for retention 
systems vary substantially within the State of Florida between the designated meteorological 

zones. 

 

 The SJRWMD requires additional dry reten
tion treatment volume when the retention 
pond is constructed as an on-line system.  Fo
r on-line systems, the SJRWMD design criteria 
become either (1) 1-inch of runoff over the entir
e site; or (2) 1.25-inch over the impervious area 
plus 0.5-inch over the entire site, whichever is 
greater.  Estimated removal efficiencies for 
projects utilizing 1 inch of dry retention are su
mmarized in Appendix D.1.  Virtually all of the 
SJRWMD is located in the central zone (Zone 2)
.  As seen in Appendix D.1., an annual removal 
efficiency of 80% can be achieved using 1 inch 
of dry retention for most projects with a DCIA 
percentage of approximately 60-65% or less and 
a non-DCIA curve number of 80 or less.  If the 
site contains an impervious percentage in excess of 40%, the SJRWMD design criteria become 

1.25-inch over the impervious area plus 0.5-inch
 over the entire site.  Assuming a worst case 
impervious percentage of approximately 80%, th
is design criterion is equal to approximately 1.5 
inch of dry retention.  As seen in Appendix D.1, 1.5-
inch of dry retention in Zone 2 is capable of 
providing the required 80% annual mass removal effi
ciency for all combinations of DCIA and 
non-DCIA curve number.  This design criterion is
 the only current water management district 
dry retention design which meets the 80% 
annual load reduction goal for all possible 
combinations of DCIA and CN values. 

 

 
5.2.1.3 Design Criteria Based on Runoff
 
from a Specified Rainfall Event
 
 
 Design criteria for retention basins in th
e Suwannee River and Southwest Florida Water 
Management Districts are referenced in terms of 
the runoff generated by a specific rainfall event, 
typically a 1-inch event.  An evaluation of the an
ticipated annual performance efficiency of retention 
basins which are designed to provide treatment of
 runoff from a 1-inch rain event was performed 
using the continuous simulation methodology discussed previously.   

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
5-27 
 
 

 A summary of calculated annual mass removal efficiencies of dry retention ponds with a 

treatment volume equivalent to the 
runoff from 1 inch of rainfall is given in Table 5-7.  In general, 
the performance efficiency of retention ponds desi
gned to this criterion appear to be relatively 
constant for each of the evaluated combinations 
of DCIA and curve number, compared with the 
trend of decreasing performance efficiency with 
increases in DCIA percentage and non-DCIA curve 
numbers observed for treatment systems designed acco
rding to a specified runoff volume.  It is 
interesting to note that the anticipated removal effi ci
ency of the dry retention system increases as the 
impervious percentage increases.  This phenom
enon occurs because the generated runoff volume 
from 1 inch of rainfall, which dictates the desi
gn treatment volume, increases as the percentage 
DCIA increases.  As a result, removal efficiencies
 remain relatively constant, since the treatment 
volume changes in response to changes in project characteristics.  The maximum anticipated 

removal efficiencies which can be achieved using a dry retention system with a treatment volume 

equivalent to 1 inch of rainfall are approximately 54-61%.   

 

 A graphical comparison of calculated annual ma
ss removal efficiencies for dry retention of 
the runoff from 1 inch of rainfall for a hypotheti
cal development with 40%
 DCIA and a non-DCIA 
curve number of 70 is given in Figure 5-7 for each
 of the five zones.  Estimated annual mass 
removal efficiencies for this design range from
 approximately 50-57%, with the lowest removal 
efficiencies obtained in the Panhandle zone and 
the higher removal efficiencies obtained in the 
Central zone.  This design criterion also falls short 
of the 80% pollutant removal efficiency specified 
by the Water Resource Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40).

 A comparison of annual mass removal efficien
cies for dry retention systems designed for 
treatment of 0.5 inch of runoff 
or the runoff from 1 inch of rainfall, based upon a hypothetical 
development with 40% DCIA and a non-DCIA curve 
number of 70, is given in Figure 5-8.  For each 
of the five meteorological zones, dry retention 
treatment for 0.5 inch of runoff provides a higher 
level of annual mass removal than criteria designed to
 treat the runoff from 1 inch of rainfall on the

5.2.2 WetDetention
 
 
 Wet detention stormwater treatment system
s are referenced by the St. Johns River, 
Suwannee River, Southwest Florida, and South Fl
orida Water Management Districts.  However, 
detailed design criteria which references residence time and pond depth are provided by only the St. 

Johns River and South Florida Water Management Di
stricts.   The design criteria established by the 
St. Johns River Water Management District provi
des for wet detention ponds with relatively short 
residence times, typically ranging from 14-21 days
, during wet season conditions.  Ponds designed 
in the St. Johns River Water Management District
 are also relatively shallow, with a maximum 
depth of 12 ft.  The South Florida Water Management
 District does not reference a specific criterion 
for residence time.  However, the District reco
mmends that 25-50% of the pond area be greater than 
12 ft in depth which tends to create ponds with 
substantially longer residence times than those 
designed within the St. Johns River Water Management District. 

 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

 Each of the four water management district
s mentioned previously provides calculations for 
a treatment volume associated with the wet dete
ntion system.  This treatment volume is often 
referred to as the ﬁwater quality volumeﬂ since the 
criteria are similar to the water quality treatment 
criteria for dry retention or dry detention.  Ho
wever, research on wet detention ponds clearly 
indicates that the most significant factor impacti
ng the performance efficiency of a wet detention 
pond is the residence time within the system - sp
ecifically, the volume of the permanent pool with 
respect  to  the  volume  of  runoff  entering  the  pond  (Toet, et al., 
1990;   Harper and Herr, 1993; 
Rushton, et al., 1995; and DB Environmental, 2005).  Since the specified treatment volumes are 

negligible in comparison to the permanent pool 
volume contained within the wet detention pond, the 
treatment volume criteria primarily regulates the drawdown characteristics of the wet detention pond 

and has little impact on the overall water quality performance efficiency of the system. 

 
Residence time within a wet detention pond is
 determined by the relationship between 
the permanent pool volume and the annual runoff inputs, as follows: 
 

 
 
where: 

 

 PPV = permanent pool volume (ac-ft) 

 

 RO = annual runoff inputs (ac-ft/yr) 
 
 

For purposes of this calculation, the permanent pool
 volume is considered to include the total 
volume of water within the pond below the control elevation.  

 

 Criteria related to residence time and pond dept
h are not included in specific design criteria 
outlined by the Suwannee River or Southwest Florida Water Management Districts.  Wet detention 

ponds designed in these districts could conceivabl
y have a wide range of detention times and 
associated performance efficiencies, with some 
ponds approaching design criteria similar to that 
used in the St. Johns River Water Management Di
strict and other ponds approaching design criteria 
utilized in the South Florida Water Management District.  As a result, estimates of the anticipated 

performance efficiency of wet detention systems 
designed in the St. Johns River and South Florida 
Water Management Districts will be presented in this
 section, with the anticipated efficiency of wet 
detention systems designed in the Suwannee River and Southwest Florida Water Management 

Districts likely to fall somewhere in between.

 5.2.2.1  SJRWMD Design Criteria
 
 
 Wet detention ponds designed according to St
. Johns River Water Management District 
(SJRWMD) criteria are characterized by relatively short residence times, ranging from 

approximately 14-21 days under wet season conditions
.  Virtually all existing research studies on 
wet detention systems, as summarized in Table 
5-2, have been performed on shallow ponds with 
relatively short residence times.  Six of the eight 
studies summarized in Table 5-2 are located in the 
St. Johns River Water Management District, although 
designs for some of the earlier studies may be 
different from current design criteria.   

 

 A summa ry of estimated performa nce effi
ciencies of wet detention ponds designed 
according to SJRWMD criteria is given in Table 5-8. 
 The values summarized in this table reflect the 
overall mean treatment efficiencies for wet deten
tion systems summarized in Table 5-2.  The values 
summarized in Table 5-8 correspond closely to perf
ormance efficiencies measured by Harper and 
Herr (1993) for a wet detention pond constructed 
according to SJRWMD criteria.  Based upon the 
estimated performance efficiency summarized in Ta
ble 5-8, with the possibl
e exception of TSS, wet 
detention ponds designed according to SJRWMD criteria fail to meet the 80% removal criteria 

outlined in Chapter 62-40.

5.2.2.2  SFWMD Design Criteria
 
 
 As discussed in a previous section, wet dete
ntion systems designed within the South Florida 
Water Management District (SFWMD) are often excav
ated to water depths of 20 ft or more.  The 
SFWMD does not have any specific limitation on pond 
depth, and developers often dig deep wet 
detention ponds to provide additional fill for low ar
eas within a development.  This technique can 
result in ponds with substantially extended detention times, often in excess of 200 days. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
5-36 
 

 
 Although more research has been performed on 
wet detention systems than other stormwater 
management systems used within the State of Florid
a, relatively few of these studies have evaluated 
the relationship between detention time and performan
ce efficiency of the system.  Only three of the 
studies summarized in Table 5-2 provide measurem
ents of performance efficiency at designated 
detention times within the pond.  The remaining studi
es lack either basic bathymetric information on 
the pond or estimates of annual r
unoff inputs, both of which are necessary to estimate pond detention 
time.  Studies summarized in Table 5-2 which provide information on pond detention time are 

generally limited to a maximum residence time of 
14 days.  Virtually no si
gnificant research has 
been conducted specifically on wet detention ponds 
with extended residence times in excess of 100-
200 days similar to those constructed in the South Florida Water Management District. 

 

 A number of urban lakes which serve as regiona
l wet detention facilities have been evaluated 
by ERD as part of water quality improvement or
 stormwater management projects.  Detailed 
hydrologic and nutrient budgets were performed on 
each of these waterbodies which typically 
included direct measurements of hydrologic inputs, 
characterization of stormwater inputs, evaluation 
of inputs from groundwater seepag
e and bulk precipitation, and evaluation of the fate of nitrogen 
and phosphorus inputs into these systems.  Each of
 these studies included an estimate of the mean 
annual residence time within the waterbody, along w
ith an estimate of annual mass removal for both 
nitrogen and phosphorus.  Estimated detention times for the waterbodies evaluated in these studies 

range from 49-769 days.  Since the evaluated wa
terbodies function as regional wet detention 
facilities, these studies provide useful information 
on the anticipated performance efficiency of wet 
ponds under extended detention time conditions. 
 
 A summary of studies relating mass removal 
of nitrogen and phosphorus as a function of 
detention time in wet detention pond is given in Ta
ble 5-9.   The studies summarized in Table 5-2 
include research performed by Rushton, et al. 
(1995) and DB Environmental (2005), along with 
additional studies performed by ERD or Harper, 
et al. on regional wet detention facilities with 
extended residence times.  Nineteen studies are av
ailable which provide simultaneous estimates of 
detention time and phosphorus removal, with some of
 the studies providing data for more than one 
detention time.  Thirteen studies provide estimates
 of nitrogen removal as a function of detention 
time.   

 

 The information contained in Table 5-9 was en
tered into a statistical database, and a linear 
regression analysis was conducted to evaluate 
relationships between removal of nitrogen and 
phosphorus as a function of residence time within 
wet ponds.  Removal efficiencies for both total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus as a function of resi
dence time were observed to exhibit curvilinear 
relationships, with a relatively rapid initial rem
oval for both nutrients, followed by a slow gradual 
increase in removal efficiency over an extended pe
riod of time.  Various curvilinear models were 
evaluated to determine the model which provided 
the best-fit for the relationship between removal 
efficiency and residence time based upon the data set summarized in Table 5-9.

 The relationship between removal efficiency 
of total phosphorus in wet detention ponds as a 
function of residence time is given in Figure 5-9.  The removal efficiency of 90% for total 

phosphorus with a 14-day residence time, provided 
by Rushton, et al. (1995), was removed from the 
data set as an outlier due to substantially elevated
 values for the Student T and Cook™s D parameters. 
 The best-fit relationship for the remaining data
 was obtained using a second-order relationship 
involving the natural log of the detention time.  
The best-fit equation is provided on Figure 5-9 for 
the relationship between removal efficiency and residence time.  This equation provides an 

extremely good fit between the two variables, with an R
2
 of 0.897.  This value indicates that 
residence time explains approximately 90% of the 
observed variability in removal effi ciencies for 
total phosphorus in wet detention ponds.  The re
maining variability is probably explained by 
experimental errors involved in the various studies
 and differences in the chemical composition of 
phosphorus species entering the various ponds.  In ge
neral, phosphorus species such as particulate 
phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) are 
removed relatively rapidly in wet detention 
ponds, while organic phosphorus is removed at a substantially lower rate.

 The relationship indicated on Figure 5-9 s
uggests that removal of phosphorus in wet 
detention ponds continues to occur, although at a 
progressively slower rate, with increases in 
residence time within the system.  A removal effici
ency of 80% can be achieved at a detention time 
of about 200 days.  The upper limit for removal effi
ciencies in wet detention ponds appears to be 
approximately 90%, although removal efficiencies 
in excess of 90% were achieved at extended 
detention times in three of the 20 studies.   At this point, total phosphorus concentrations within wet 

detention ponds appear to approach irreducible 
concentrations which reflect natural background 
phosphorus levels in surface waterbodies. 
 
 Relationships between detention time and removal efficiencies for total nitrogen in wet 

detention ponds are illustrated on Figure 5-10.  The 
data points presented on this figure are based 
upon the referenced studies summarized in Table 5-
9.  The annual mass removal efficiency of 63% 
reported by Rushton, et al. (1995) for a wet pond with
 a detention time of 14 days and the removal 
efficiency of 33% for a 2-day detention time were eliminated from the data set as outliers due to 

elevated values for the Student T and Cook™s D parameters.

 Figure 5-10. Removal Efficiency of Total Nitrogen in Wet Detention Ponds as a 

   FunctionofResidenceTime. 

 

 
 
 

 The best-fit for the relationship between rem
oval effi ciency and detention time for total 
nitrogen was obtained using a hyperbolic equation.  Th
e final version of this equation is summarized 
on Figure 5-10.   The R
2
 value of 0.800 suggests that detention time explains approximately 80% of 
the observed variability in removal efficiencies for total nitrogen in wet detention ponds.  The 

remaining variability in removal efficiencies for to
tal nitrogen is likely due to variability in methods 
of analysis between the listed studies as well as 
variability in the dominant nitrogen form present in 
the stormwater inflows.  In general, 
inorganic forms of nitrogen (ammonia and NO
x
) and particulate 
nitrogen are removed relatively rapidly in wet dete
ntion ponds.  The initial rapid removal of nitrogen 
within the first 10-20 days, indicated on Figure 5-
10, is probably a result of the rapid uptake of 
inorganic nitrogen and the settling of particulate sp
ecies.  Other forms of nitrogen, such as organic 
nitrogen, are removed at a substantially slower rate and are likely responsible for the dramatic 

slowdown in removal efficiency observed for total nitrogen after approximately 20-30 days. 

 

 The hyperbolic relationship summarized on Figur
e 5-10 indicates that a removal efficiency 
of approximately 40% can be achieved for total n
itrogen in 50 days, with a maximum efficiency of 
approximately 45% at extended detention periods.   
The lack of additional removal efficiencies for 
total nitrogen observed at extended detention times
 is probably a reflection of either phosphorus 
limitation or that irreducible concentrations of total nitrogen have been achieved within the pond. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
5-40 
 
 

 The relationships summarized in Figures 5-
9 and 5-10 suggest that wet detention ponds 
designed in the South Florida Water Management Di
strict with extended detention times in excess 
of 200 days are likely to achieve approximately
 80-85% removal for total phosphorus and 40-45% 
removal for total nitrogen on an annual basis.  A
lthough the estimated removal efficiencies for total 
phosphorus meet the goal of 80% removal for stor
mwater management systems outlined in the 
Water Resource Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40 FAC), removal of total nitrogen in wet 

detention ponds, even at extended detention periods, still fails to meet the 80% goal. 

 

 
5.2.3 DryDetention
 
 
 As discussed in Section 5.1.3, dry detention syst
ems, constructed with or without filtration/ 
underdrain systems, exhibit highly variable remova
l efficiencies which are influenced to a large 
extent by the relationships between the seas
onal high groundwater table elevation and the pond 
bottom.  Detention systems which provide infiltra
tion for a large portion of the runoff inputs have 
exhibited substantially higher removal efficiencies 
than detention systems which are constructed at 
or below the groundwater table elevation.  Because
 of the high degree of 
variability in removal 
efficiencies observed for dry detention systems, th
ere is no presumption that these systems will meet 
the outlined goals of the Water Resource Implementation Rule for stormwater management systems. 

 This fact has been recognized by the St. Johns Ri
ver and South Florida Water Management Districts 
which now discourage the use of dry detention syst
ems (with or without filtration/underdrains) in 
new development.  Since other stormwater manageme
nt options are available, such as dry retention 
or wet detention, which provide reliable and predicta
ble pollutant removal efficiencies, dry detention 
systems should be eliminated as a common stormwat
er management technique within the State of 
Florida.

SECTION  6 
 

 RECOMMENDED  MODIFICATIONS 
TO  EXISTING  STORMWATER 
DESIGN  CRITERIA
 
 
 

 This section provides an analysis of potentia
l modifications to existing stormwater design 
criteria within the State of Florida to meet 
the performance objectives outlined in the Water 
Resource Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40 FA
C).  This rule requires that stormwater 
management systems achieve at least an 80% re
duction of the average annual load of pollutants 
that would cause or contribute to violations of 
State water quality standards.  If the stormwater 
management system discharges to a desi
gnated OFW or other protected waterbody, the 
performance criteria increases to a 95% reduction. 
 Based on the analyses presented in Section 
5.2, with the exception of the SMRWMD design 
criteria for on-line dry retention, existing 
stormwater design criteria fail to consistently m
eet either the 80% or 95% target goals outlined 
in Chapter 62-40.  

 

 In addition to modifications required to
 achieve the 80% and 95% pollutant load 
reduction goals, an analysis is also provided in 
this section of the design criteria necessary to 
achieve a condition of no net increase in pollutant 
loadings for a developed site compared with 
loadings which would have reasonably been 
thought to discharge from the site under pre-
development conditions.  Implementation of these 
criteria would ensure that land developments 
do not cause a net degradation of water resources w
ithin the State.  This objective is supported in 
Chapter 62-40.341 in the section titled ﬁStormwater 
Management Programﬂ, which states that 
ﬁthe primary goals of the State™s Stormwater 
Management Program are to maintain, to the 
maximum extent practical, during and after cons
truction and development, the pre-development 
stormwater characteristics of a site;  –ﬂ. 

 

 The analyses presented in the subsequent 
sections are provided for total nitrogen and 
total phosphorus which are two of the most common pollutants in urban runoff. Although total 

suspended solids (TSS) is also a significant constitu
ent in stormwater runoff, the removal of TSS 
within stormwater management systems occurs at a much more rapid rate than is commonly 

observed for either total nitrogen or total phosphor
us.  Therefore, if a stormwater management 
system provides the required removal efficiency
 for both total nitrogen and total phosphorus, the 
system will easily provide the same pollutant removal efficiency for TSS. 

 

 Another common constituent in stormwat
er runoff is biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD).  Inputs of BOD into surface water can cau
se oxygen depletion, resulting in fish kills and 
changes in aquatic diversity.  Upon entering an 
aquatic environment, organic matter is rapidly 
degraded by a variety of microorganisms within the water.  The degradation and removal 

processes for BOD in surface waters have b
een well documented, and removal of BOD as a 
function of time has been shown to observe the following first-order equation:

 t=time(days) 

 

 K = decomposition constant (time

) 
 

 

 

 BOD decomposition constants (K) in surface 
waters are temperature-dependent but are 
typically on the order of 0.1/day.  A graphical re
presentation of the theoretical removal of BOD 
as a function of time, based upon a decomposition 
constant of 0.1/day, is given in Figure 6-1. 
This relationship can be used to estimate the 
time required to achieve a certain BOD removal 
efficiency within a wet detention pond.  A removal 
efficiency of approximately 80% is achieved 
for BOD after a residence time of 
approximately 15 days, with removal efficiencies in excess of 
95% after approximately 30-35 days.  As a result, 
the removal of BOD in aquatic systems occurs 
at a much more rapid rate than removal of to
tal nitrogen or total phosphorus, as indicated in 
Figures 5-10 and 5-11.  Therefore, if a stormw
ater management system provides the required 
removal efficiency for both total nitrogen and total phosphorus, the system will also easily 

provide the same pollutant removal efficiency for BOD.

 The recommended design criteria discussed in 
this section include only dry retention and 
wet detention as potential stormwater manageme
nt options.  Based on the discussion presented 
in Section 5, these systems provide predictable a
nd consistent pollutant removal efficiencies for 
a wide range of stormwater pollutants.  For purposes
 of this analysis, the term ﬁretentionﬂ can be 
used to mean a dry pond, swales, underground exf
iltration, or any other practice which provides 
for recovery of a specified stormwater treatment volume by infiltration into the soil or 

evaporation.  Dry detention stormwater management
 systems, either with or without filtration/ 
underdrains, are not included as a viable stormwater
 management alternative in this section.  As 
discussed previously, dry detention systems 
are characterized by highly variable removal 
efficiencies which depend heavily upon construc
tion of the system with respect to the 
groundwater table elevation.  Dry detention sy
stems which have performed well in field 
evaluations have performed similar to dry reten
tion basins, while poor removal efficiencies have 
been achieved in dry detention systems with little or no infiltration. 

 

 
6.1  Design Criteria to Achieve 80% Removal
 
 

6.1.1 Dry Retention Systems
 
 
 Since a first-flush effect is not assumed for 
this analysis, removal of 80% of the pollutant 
mass is achieved by retention of 80% of the annua
l runoff volume.  Estimates of the retention 
volume required to achieve 80% removal of the annual stormwater runoff volume was calculated 

for each of the five meteorological zones and 
a variety of DCIA percentages and non-DCIA 
curve numbers.  This information was extracted fr
om the performance efficiency tables for dry 
retention provided in Appendix D which were u
tilized to find the required retention depth to 
achieve an annual treatment efficiency of 
80% or more for each combination of DCIA 
percentage and non-DCIA curve numbe
r.  If the treatment efficiency for a given combination of 
retention depth, DCIA percentage, and non-DC
IA curve number exceeded 80%, the retention 
depth was interpolated using the next lower re
tention depth to achieve an estimated annual 
treatment efficiency of exactly 80% for each 
combination of DCIA percentage and non-DCIA 
curve number. 

 

 A summary of required retention depths to 
achieve an annual mass removal efficiency of 
80% for dry retention systems is given in Table 
6-1 for each of the five 
meteorological zones. 
The state-wide average is provided at the top of 
Table 6-1.  On a state-wi
de average, retention 
depths necessary to achieve an annual removal efficiency of 80% range from 0.22-1.92 inches of 

runoff, depending upon the combination of DCIA 
percentage and non-DCIA curve number.  The 
retention depths necessary to achieve 80% remova
l efficiency are lowest in the Central zone 
areas, with the highest retention depths required in the Panhandle areas.   

 

 A graphical illustration of state-wide averag
e retention depths required to achieve an 
80% annual removal efficiency as a function of
 DCIA percentage and non-DCIA curve number 
is given in Figure 6-2.  Increases in the DCIA
 percentage and non-DCIA curve number clearly 
result in increases in the required retention 
depth necessary to achieve an 80% annual mass 
removal efficiency.

 Variations in required dry retention depth to achieve 80% removal in the Central zone are 

illustrated on Figure 6-3 as an example of an 
area with lower than average retention depth 
requirements.  Required dry retention depths in 
the Central zone area range from approximately 
0.22-1.43 inches depending upon the combination of
 DCIA percentage and non-DCIA curve 
number.  Variations in required dry retention 
depth to achieve 80% removal in the Panhandle 
area are illustrated on Figure 6-4 as an example of
 an area with higher than average retention 
depth requirements.  At high values for DCIA
 percentage and non-DCIA curve number, the 
retention depth required to achieve 80% removal 
is substantially greater in the Panhandle region 
than in the Central region.  As discussed previ
ously, these variations are primarily due to the 
differences in the distribution of typical rain events. 
 
 A summary of recommended design criteria fo
r dry retention ponds to achieve an annual 
removal efficiency of 80% is given in Table 
6-2.  Recovery of the required treatment volume 
must be achieved within 72 hours or less, equiva
lent to the volume recovery period utilized for 
generation of the performance efficiency tables
 summarized in Appendix D.  Ability of the pond 
to achieve this recovery rate must be certified 
by a registered geotechnical engineer.  All side 
slopes and bottom areas of the pond must be seeded
 or sodded with water-tolerant grass species 
grown on sandy soils.  If sod is used as the 
vegetative cover on the bottom of the pond, changes 
in permeability of the basin resulting from the sod must be included in evaluation of the recovery 

period for the pond.  Inlets and outlets must be lo
cated as far apart as possible to prevent short-
circuiting.  Oil and grease skimmers must be
 provided at all outfall structures.  Other 
requirements related to side slopes, fencing, maintenance berms, and access will adhere to 

applicable local agency criteria.

6.1.2 WetDetention
   
 
 Wet detention systems provide reliable and pr
edictable pollutant removal efficiencies and 
can play a significant part in stormwater manage
ment for virtually any type of development. 
However, as discussed in Section 5.2, wet dete
ntion ponds with short detention times (14-21 
days) fail to achieve the 80% pollutant removal 
efficiency for either total nitrogen or total 
phosphorus.  Wet detention ponds designed with extended detention periods can achieve the 

80% removal criteria for total phosphorus, but will 
fail to achieve this efficiency for total 
nitrogen. Therefore, if 80% removal is necessary
 for total nitrogen, wet detention ponds must be 
used as part of a treatment train approach to
 achieve the target removal efficiency for both 
nitrogen and phosphorus.   
 

A summary of recommended design criteria for we
t detention ponds is given in Table 6-3.  
Based upon the information presented previously, 
the most important factor in regulating the 
performance efficiency of a wet detention pond is
 the residence time for runoff inputs within the 
system.  Assuming that short circuiting does not occu
r, residence time is determined primarily by the 
permanent pool volume, and this volume becomes 
the single most important design parameter for 
wet detention ponds.  The required volume of the 
permanent pool can be calculated based upon the 
removal relationships presented previously in
 Figures 5-9 (total phosphorus) and 5-10 (total 
nitrogen).  Design criteria are also listed for the treatment volume, which represents the water 

volume stored on top of the permanent pool during an individual rain event.  Pond requirements for 

treatment volume and recovery time for the treatment volume are based upon current water 

management district criteria. 
 

Design criteria for pond depth are based upon the an
ticipated depth of the anoxic zone within 
the pond based on the anticipated productivity of th
e pond.  This concept is discussed further in 
Section 6.4.  No restrictions are placed on the conf
iguration of the pond, provided that the inlet and 
outlet from the system are located as far apart as 
possible to maximize travel path.  In addition, it is 
recommended that at least 20% of the pond surface be
 planted with a littoral zone consisting of a 
combination of submergent and emergent aquatic ve
getation.  Creation of a littoral zone will create a 
more diverse environment and will probably enhance the overall performance efficiency of the wet 

detention system.

As indicated previously, wet detention system
s must be utilized as part of a treatment 
train to achieve the required 80% removal efficiency specified under the Water Resource 

Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40).  When treatme
nt systems are used in series as part of a 
treatment train, the efficiency of the overall treat
ment train can be calculated using the following 
equation: 
 
 

 
Overall Treatment Train Efficiency (decimal)  =  Eff
1
  +  (1 Œ Eff
1
)  x  Eff
2  
(Eq. 1) 
 
 

 

where: 

 

 Eff
1
 = effi ciency of initial treatment system (decimal) 
 

 Eff
2
 = efficiency of second treatment system (decimal) 
 

 

 

After treatment in the initial system, a load reduc
tion has occurred which is a function of the type 
of treatment provided.  After migrating through th
e initial treatment system, the remaining load 
consists of mass which was not removed in the 
initial system.  This mass is then acted upon by 
the second treatment system with an efficiency a
ssociated with the particular type of system 
used. The overall efficiency can then be calculated according to the above equation. 
 
To achieve an overall annual mass load reduction of 80% using wet detention, a pre-
treatment system must first be used to provi
de a significant portion of the desired pollutant 
removal effectiveness.  For example, assume
 that a wet detention pond is designed with a 
detention period of approximately 50 days which is
 sufficient to achieve a removal efficiency of 
approximately 40% for total nitrogen.  Utilizing the relationship summarized as Eq. 1, and 

assuming that the efficiency of the wet detention system for total nitrogen (40%) is represented 

by Eff
2
, the effi ciency of the initial treatment system (Eff
1
) would need to be 67% to achieve an 
overall treatment efficiency of 80%. 
 

Depending upon the characteristics of the de
velopment and the meteorological region, 
achieving an initial 67% annual mass load reduc
tion using retention will require between 0.25-
0.75 inch of dry retention as pre-treatment.  Wh
en pre-treatment is provided and the remaining 
stormwater is discharged into the wet deten
tion pond, the overall treatment system will achieve a 
mass removal effi ciency of 80% for total nitr
ogen.  The mass removal efficiency for total 
phosphorus and other significant pollutants will be substantially in excess of 80%.

 6.2  Design Criteria to Achieve 95% Removal
  
 

6.2.1 DryRetention
 
 
An evaluation of required retention depths to 
achieve an annual removal efficiency of 95%, 
corresponding to the OFW criteria outlined in the 
Water Resource Implementation Rule (Chapter 
62-40), was performed using the same methodology ou
tlined previously for evaluation of retention 
criteria based upon an 80% annual mass load reducti
on.  To achieve an annual mass load reduction 
of 95%, it is assumed that 95% of the annual runoff volume must be removed by the retention 

system.  A summary of required retention depths to
 achieve an annual removal efficiency of 95% for 
each of the five zones is given in Table 6-4.  
Treatment depths necessary to achieve 95% annual 
pollutant mass removal range from 2.99-3.98 inches 
of retention over the project area, based upon 
location and variations in DCIA percentage and non-DCIA curve number.   
 
Variations in required dry retention depth to
 achieve 95% removal on a state-wide average 
basis are illustrated on Figure 6-5. 
 The lowest retention depths necessary to achieve 95% annual 
mass removal occur at low values for DCIA percen
tage and non-DCIA curve number.  However, as 
DCIA percentages and non-DCIA curve numbers in
crease, retention treatment requirements also 
increase, approaching values ranging from 3.2-3.4 in
ches of retention.  Similar to the trends 
observed with the analysis for 80% removal, a higher than average retention depth is necessary in 

the Panhandle and Florida Keys to achieve a 95% 
removal, while a lower than average retention 
depth would be necessary in Central areas. 
 
 

6.2.2 WetDetention
 
 
As indicated in previous sections, wet deten
tion systems are not capable of providing a 95% 
pollutant removal efficiency for either total nitr
ogen or total phosphorus, even at extended detention 
periods.  Therefore, to achieve the 95% removal obj
ective for discharges to OFWs, a treatment train 
approach must be used with wet detention used 
in series with a high efficiency pre-treatment 
management technique.  
 

To achieve an overall annual mass load re
duction of 95% using wet detention, a pre-
treatment system must be used to provide a significant portion of the desired pollutant removal 

efficiency.  As an example, assumed that a wet detention pond is designed with a detention period of 

approximately 50 days which is sufficient to achieve
 a removal efficiency of approximately 40% for 
total nitrogen.  Using the relationship summarized as
 Eq. 1, and assuming that the efficiency of the 
wet detention system for total nitrogen (40%) is represented by Eff
2
, the efficiency of the initial 
treatment system (Eff
1
) would need to be 92% to achieve an
 overall treatment efficiency of 95%. 
When pre-treatment is provided and the remaining st
ormwater is discharged into the wet detention 
pond, the overall treatment system will achieve a mass 
removal efficiency of 95% for total nitrogen. 
However, the mass removal for total phosphorus and 
other significant pollutants will be in excess of 
95%.

6.3 Design Criteria to Achieve Post-Development
 
Less Than or Equal to Pre-Development Loadings
 
 
An analysis was also performed to provide estimates of the annual mass pollutant removal 
efficiencies necessary to achieve no net increa
se in pollutant loadings following development 
compared with loadings which discharge from the site under pre-development conditions.  This 

analysis is conducted primarily for nitrogen a
nd phosphorus, since systems which achieve post <
 pre 
pollutant loadings for nitrogen and phosphorus will 
automatically provide this condition for TSS, 
BOD, and other significant runoff pollutants. 

 

 
6.3.1 Estimation of Pre-Development Pollutant Loadings
 
 
This analysis assumes that the undeveloped 
condition consists of brush (brush-weed-grass 
mixture), woods, or a mixture of the two.  A 
summary of hydrologic assumptions for this pre-
development condition is given in Table 6-5. 
 For estimation of annual runoff volumes, the 
hydrologic  condition  is assumed to be fair, w
ith 50-75% ground cover and litter covering much of 
the soil.  SCS curve numbers for use in hydrol
ogic modeling are assumed for hydrologic soil groups 
(HSG) A, B, C, and D using the average curve num
bers for brush and wooded areas provided in the 
TR-55 publication.

Calculated annual C values for undeveloped/na
tural areas are summarized in Table 6-6 for 
each of the regional meteorological zones.  Th
ese values are calculated using the continuous 
simulation technique discussed in Section 4.2 and 
the hydrologic characteristics listed in Table 6-5. 
The mean values summarized at the bottom of Table 6-6 reflect the state-wide mean rather than the 

arithmetic mean of the values for each zone. In 
general, approximately 1.5% or less of the annual 
rainfall which occurs on undeveloped/natural ar
eas under HSG A conditions becomes stormwater 
runoff.  Under HSG B conditions, this percentage
 increases to approximately 4-7%, with 9-13% 
under HSG C conditions and 13-18% under HSG D conditions.

Estimates of annual runoff depths for undevel
oped/natural areas were calculated using the 
methodology outlined in Section 4.2.1 for each of the 
five meteorological zones and four hydrologic 
soil groups.  A summary of calculated runoff depths 
for undeveloped/natural areas is given in Table 
6-7 for each of the five meteorological zones.  Th
e runoff depth presented for each zone is calculated 
by multiplying the annual C value for each hydrologic soil group (summarized in Table 6-6) times 

the mean annual rainfall for each zone.  The values summarized in Table 6-7 reflect estimates of the 

long-term mean annual runoff depth for undeveloped/na
tural areas in each of the five zones based 
upon available rainfall data.  A relatively high degree 
of variability is apparent in calculated annual

Estimates of annual mass loadings of 
nitrogen and phosphorus discharging from 
undeveloped/natural areas were generated for each
 of the hydrologic soil groups and meteorological 
zones included in Tables 6-6 and 6-7.  The annua
l runoff volume generated by each combination of 
meteorological zone and hydrologic soil group was cal
culated, assuming a theoretical area of 1 acre, 
using the annual runoff coefficients summarize
d in Table 6-6 and the annual rainfall depth 
represented by each meteorological site.  The estimated annual runoff volumes were then multiplied 

by the assumed runoff characteristics for undevelope
d/natural areas summarized in Table 4-17.  For 
purposes of this analysis, total nitrogen concentr
ations in runoff discharging from undeveloped/ 
natural areas is assumed to be 1.15 mg/l, with a total phosphorus concentration of 0.055 mg/l. 
 

Estimates of the annual mass loadings of n
itrogen and phosphorus generated by stormwater 
runoff in undeveloped/natural areas are summarized 
in Table 6-8.  Annual mass loads are calculated 
for each hydrologic soil group and meteorological z
one in terms of kg/acre-year for both total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus.  The values summarized in this table represent the pre-development  

loadings  generated  by  undeveloped/na
tural areas for each hydrologic soil group and 
meteorological zone.  To achieve the goal of no 
net increase in loadings following development, 
discharges of total nitrogen and total phosphorus 
from the land parcel following development cannot 
exceed the pre-development values listed in Table 6-8.

6.3.2 Estimation of Post-Development Pollutant Loadings
 
 
When a stormwater management system is designed to provide sufficient treatment so that 
the post-development loadings from a parcel are e
qual to or less than the pre-development loadings 
from the parcel, the post-development loadings
 would be calculated based upon the specific 
hydrologic and land use characteristics of the site, combined with the anticipated pollutant removal 

effectiveness of the proposed stormwater treatment 
option.  However, for purposes of this analysis 
and to provide estimates of the magnitude of pollu
tant removal efficiencies necessary to achieve no 
net increase in pollutant loadings following deve
lopment, calculations of estimated annual mass 
loadings for nitrogen and phosphorus were perfor
med for ﬁtypicalﬂ residential and commercial 
developments, including low-density residential, singl
e-family residential, high-density residential, 
and commercial land use categories. 
 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

A summary of hydrologic assumptions used for th
e developed land use categories is given in 
Table 6-9.  The low-density residential areas are 
assumed to have approximately 15% impervious 
area, with 5% of the area as 
DCIA.  Hydrologic characteristics are provided for single-family 
residential developments based on 25% impervious
 and 40% impervious conditions.  High-density 
residential areas are assumed to be 65% impervi
ous, with 80% impervious assumed for commercial 
activities.  Highway land use categories are al
so included, based upon 50% and 75% impervious 
assumptions. Curve numbers for pervious areas ar
e based on soil types and assumptions regarding 
landscaped conditions.

Estimates of the annual runoff coefficients 
for each of the developed land use categories 
were generated using the methodology outlined in
 Section 4.2.1 and the hydrologic characteristics 
summarized in Table 6-9.  Separate calculations were
 performed for each of the five meteorological 
zones and four hydrologic soil groups for each iden
tified land use category.  Separate calculations 
were performed for each of the hourly meteorological
 monitoring sites contained within each of the 
five zones, and the mean runoff coefficient wa
s calculated for each combination of development 
category, soil type, and zone. A summary of calcu
lated annual runoff coefficients for typical 
developed land use categories is given in Table 6-
10.   The values summarized in Table 6-10 reflect 
long-term average runoff coefficients based 
upon the available period of record for hourly 
meteorological sites within each of the five zones.
 In general, estimated annual runoff coefficients 
increase with changes in hydrologic soil group and increases in land use intensity.

Estimates of annual runoff depths for typical
 developed land use categories and hydrologic 
soil groups are summarized in Table 6-11.  These 
values are calculated by multiplying the annual 
runoff coefficients (summarized in Table 6-10)
 by the annual average rainfall for each of the 
designated meteorological zones. 
 

Estimates of annual mass loadings of total n
itrogen and total phosphorus for typical land use 
categories were calculated by multiplying the es
timated annual runoff volume generated by each 
developed land use category and soil type times 
the recommended runoff characterization data for 
total nitrogen and total phosphorus summarized 
in Table 4-17.  Annual runoff volumes were 
estimated for a theoretical 1 acre parcel by multiplying the annual runoff coefficients (summarized in 

Table 6-10) times the mean annual rainfall for each meteorological zone.  This value was then 

multiplied by the typical concentrations summarized
 in Table 4-17 for total nitrogen and total 
phosphorus to obtain estimates of annual mass loadi
ngs for a wide variety of developed land use 
categories and hydrologic soil group types. 
 

Calculated annual total nitrogen loadings for 
typical land use categories are summarized in 
Table 6-12.  The values summarized in these tables reflect the estimated annual total nitrogen load 

discharging from each evaluated land use category 
and soil group type.  In general, total nitrogen 
loadings increase as the intensity of developm
ent increases and soil permeability decreases. 
Calculated annual total phosphorus loadings for t
ypical land use categories are summarized in Table 
6-13.  The values summarized in this table are cal
culated in the same manner as that previously 
described for total nitrogen.  In general, estimated
 annual total phosphorus loadings also increase as 
the intensity of land development increases and soil permeability decreases. 

 
 
6.3.3 Estimated Annual Removal Efficiencies
 
 
Required annual removal efficiencies were 
calculated to reduce the estimated annual 
loadings of total nitrogen (summarized in Table 
6-12) and total phosphorus (summarized in Table 6-
13) to values equal to or less than the estimated
 annual mass loadings of nitrogen and phosphorus for 
undeveloped/natural areas summarized in Table 
6-8.  This analysis was conducted for each 
evaluated land use category, soil type, and meteorological zone. 
 

A summary of required removal efficien
cies to achieve post-development <
 pre-
development loadings for total nitrogen is given in Table 6-14.  In general, required removal 

efficiencies for total nitrogen range from a
pproximately 54-99%, depending upon the particular 
combination of land use category and soil type.  
The largest required removal efficiencies are 
required for multi-family and commercial areas. 
 

Required removal efficiencies to achieve post-development <
 pre-development loadings for 
total phosphorus are summarized in Table 6-15.  Re
quired removals for total phosphorus range from 
approximately 82-99%, depending upon the specific 
combination of land use type, hydrologic soil 
group, and meteorological location.

Differences between the required removal e
fficiencies for nitrogen and phosphorus to 
achieve no net increase in loading under post-deve
lopment conditions are due primarily to the 
differences   in   runoff   characteristics   for   ge
neral   land   use  categor
ies  between  nitrogen  and 
phosphorus.  As seen in Table 4-17, nitrogen concen
trations increase by a factor of approximately 
1.1-3 under developed conditions, compared with 
values measured under undeveloped conditions. 
However, total phosphorus concentrations increase by 
a factor of approximately 3-9, suggesting that 
removal efficiencies for total phosphorus need to be
 greater than those which occur for total nitrogen 
to reach pre-development loading conditions.  
 

A graphical comparison of required removal effi
ciencies to achieve no net increase in post-
development loadings is given in Figure 6-6 for 
low-density residential areas, Figure 6-7 for single-
family residential (25% impervious), Figure 6-8 for single-family residential (40% impervious), 

Figure 6-9 for high-density residential, Figure 
6-10 for commercial areas, Figure 6-11 for highway 
areas (50% impervious), and Figure 6-12 for highw
ay areas with 75% impervious.  A stormwater 
management system designed according to the goal of the Water Resource Implementation Rule 

(Chapter 62-40) of 80% removal will achieve a no ne
t increase in nitrogen loadings for low-density 
residential areas and single-family residential (
25% impervious) constructed in HSG B, C, and D 
soils, single-family residential (40% impervious),
 and highway areas (50% impervious) constructed 
in HSG D soils.  However, these same developments
 constructed in HSG A soils and other soil types 
not listed will fail to meet this criterion and will n
eed supplemental stormwater treatment to achieve 
the goal of no net increase in nitrogen loadings. 

 
A stormwater management system designed fo
r 80% removal will not achieve a condition of 
no net increase for total phosphorus for any of the ev
aluated land use categories.  In some  cases, 
removal  efficiencies  as  high 
 as  99% must be achieved to obtain the goal of no net increase in 
phosphorus loadings, particularly for development 
constructed in HSG A areas.  Even systems 
constructed to OFW design criteria, equivalent to a 95% annual mass removal, will fail to meet the 

objective of no net increase in total phosphorus load
ings for many combinations of land use category 
and hydrologic soil group. 

 

 

 
6.4  Evaluation of Wet Detention Pond Depth
 
 

6.4.1 Theory of Shallow vs. Deep Ponds
 
 
 One of the most controversial design para
me t e rs for st ormwa t e r mana ge me nt  syst e ms 
involves the constructed depth for wet detention 
ponds.  As discussed in Section 5.2.2, wet detention 
systems designed in the St. Johns River Water Mana
gement District are limited to a maximum of 12 
ft in depth, with a mean depth ranging from 2-8 ft
, and relatively short detention times ranging from 
14-21 days during wet season conditions.  In contrast
, the South Florida Water Management District 
recommends that 25-50% of the pond area be greater 
than 12 ft in depth which tends to create ponds 
with detention times on the order of several hundred days.

 Neither of the design criteria outlined in th
e previous paragraph is supported by specific 
research projects designed to address allowabl
e depths for wet detention ponds.  The depth 
limitation of 12 ft for wet detention ponds designe
d in the St. Johns River Water Management 
District appears to have been influenced by severa
l previous research projects designed to evaluate 
the effectiveness of a particular wet detention 
pond design.  These ponds, which were coincidentally 
designed to a maximum depth of approximately 
12 ft, maintained aerobic conditions throughout the 
water column of each pond, resulting in the conclu
sion that wet detention ponds constructed to a 
depth of 12 ft would maintain aerobic conditions. 

 

 In order to understand factors which may imp
act the allowable depths for wet detention 
ponds, it is essential to understand that wet dete
ntion ponds are simply man-made lake systems 
subject to the same physical, chemical, and biological
 processes which exist in natural lake systems. 
Virtually every lake in Florida, particularly 
in urbanized environments, acts as a regional wet 
detention facility for runoff inputs generated from
 the surrounding areas.  The limnological concepts 
of nutrient uptake, chemical and biological 
transformations, and primary productivity are no 
different in waterbodies which have been assigne
d permit numbers than in waterbodies which have 
been assigned formal names. 

 

 The underlying assumption in maximizing the 
pollutant removal effectiveness of a wet 
detention pond is that aerobic conditions must be 
maintained throughout the water column at all 
times.  Assuming that aerobic conditions are reflect
ed by dissolved oxygen concentrations in excess 
of 1 mg/l, this means that dissolved oxygen concentr
ations must be in excess of 1 mg/l within the 
water column at all times. 
 

The depth of anoxia in a waterbody, defined as
 the water depth at which dissolved oxygen 
concentrations drop below 1 mg/l, is highly corre
lated with the algal productivity which exists 
within the pond.  At low levels of algal productivity, 
light penetration can extend to deeper layers of 
the pond, which increases the portion of the water column in which photosynthetic activities take 

place and increases the depth of anoxia.  As algal 
productivity increases, light penetration into the 
water column is restricted, and the depth of anoxia 
begins to approach closer to the surface. This 
phenomenon is well documented by limnologists who consistently observe that eutrophic lakes with 

high levels of algal productivity often develop anoxi
c conditions at a relatively shallow water depth, 
while lake systems exhibiting oligotrophic charact
eristics and low algal productivity often maintain 
aerobic conditions to depths of 30-
40 ft.  The fact that a wet detention pond is constructed to a 
maximum depth of 12 ft in no way 
guarantees that aerobic conditions will be maintained within the 
pond at all times.  In fact, a wet detention pond w
ith a deeper depth and larger permanent pool 
volume, receiving the same mass loadings as a 12-
ft deep pond, would exhibit substantially lower 
algal productivity and have a correspondingly deeper 
depth for the anoxic zone.  As a result, the 
allowable depth of a wet detention pond should be ev
aluated with respect to the anticipated algal 
productivity within the pond rather than an arb
itrary depth which may or may not achieve the 
objective of maintaining aerobic conditions within the water column. 

 

 Maximizing the depth of a wet detention 
pond while still maintaining aerobic conditions 
provides several significant water quality benefits. 
 First, deeper ponds generally have a larger 
permanent pool volume which decreases the likelihood of water quality violations at the outfall from 

runoff  inputs  entering  the  pond.  When a pond 
has a detention time of several hundred days, 
runoff  inputs  into  the  system  reflect  a  very 
 small  percentage  of  the  available permanent pool 
volume.  This permanent pool volume provides signi
ficant attenuation and dilution for runoff inputs, 
minimizing variability in discharges from the pond 
and water quality violations.  On the other hand, 
runoff inputs into a pond with a relatively short 
detention time comprise a significantly larger 
portion of the permanent pool volume, increasing th
e likelihood of water quality violations at the 
outfall. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
6-44 
 

 
 Another advantage of deeper ponds is the incr
eased storage for suspended solids provided in 
these systems.  As shallow detention ponds begin 
to fill in with sediments, aquatic vegetation 
(commonly cattails) begins to encroach into 
the pond, creating significant negative water quality 
impacts.  In deeper ponds, this phenomenon is substantially postponed.  Shallow ponds with a short 

residence time also tend to be highly productive and often have aesthetically unpleasing algal 

blooms.  Homeowners associations often contract 
with aquatic weed control companies to correct 
these visual concerns using herbicides or coppe
r-based algicides, both of which decrease the 
performance efficiency of the pond and increase th
e likelihood of water quality violations at the 
pond outfall. 

 

  
6.4.2 Zonation and Stratification
 
 
Typical zonation in a pond or lake is illust
rated on Figure 6-13.  The upper portions of 
the water column in a waterbody are typically well mixed, with a relatively uniform temperature. 

This upper layer, often called the epilimnion, is
 the area in which the majority of algal 
production within the lake occurs.  In this
 zone, photosynthesis exceeds respiration, and 
adequate levels of dissolved oxygen are typically 
maintained.  Lower layers of a lake are often 
isolated from the upper layers as a result of
 thermal stratification within the waterbody. 
Penetration of sunlight into these lower layers
 is typically poor, and as a result, little algal 
productivity occurs in these areas.  In this lo
wer zone, commonly referred to as the hypolimnion, 
respiration exceeds photosynthesis, and the wate
r column may become void of dissolved oxygen 
during portions of the year.   
 
 
Figure 6-13.  Typical Zonation in a Lake or Pond. 
 

 

 
 Development of stratification in waterbodies 
occurs primarily as a result of differential 
absorption  of  solar  energy  w
ithin  the  water  column resulting in relatively large temperature 
differences between the upper warm epilimnion wate
r and the lower cooler hypolimnion water.  In 
Florida, temperature differences as high as 8-10
C can occur during the summer months between 
the epilimnion and the hypolimnion in a deep water
body.  Temperature differences within the water 
column result in density gradients which inhibit 
circulation between surface and deeper portions of 
the water column, resulting in stable stratified conditions.

 Under stratified conditions, the hypolimni
on becomes isolated from oxygen input 
mechanisms such as reaeration from the surface and algal production, and anaerobic conditions may 

develop in deeper waters.  Anaerobic or anoxic c
onditions are considered to occur when dissolved 
oxygen concentrations in portions of a waterbody decrease to less than 1 mg/l.  These conditions 

may increase the release of ions such as ammonia and orthophosphorus, along with gases such as 

H
2
S and CO
2
, from the bottom sediments into 
the hypolimnion water where significant 
accumulation of these ions and gases can occur.
  The accumulated constituents in the hypolimnion 
can then be circulated into the epilimnion as a re
sult of a destratifying event, such as a prolonged 
windy period or strong storm event, theoretically 
resulting in episodes of reduced water quality. 
Circulation may also occur naturally within a waterbody with seasonal changes in temperature. 
 
 Stratified conditions commonly develop as a re
sult of absorption of solar energy by particles 
in the water column, either as a result of turbid
ity or by excess algal production near the surface.  
Both inorganic particles and organic matter can
 strongly absorb solar radiation and create a 
significant degree of stratification and a sharp decrease in temperature in the water column at depths 

below 4-6 feet if large quantities of suspended matte
r are present in the water column.  However, if 
significant suspended matter is not present in the wa
ter column, waterbodies as deep as 20 feet or 
more may not experience stratification or anaerobic conditions at deeper water depths. 

 

 One method of evaluating the potential for st
ratification in a waterbody is to perform 
estimates of anticipated algal production and corresponding chlorophyll-a values within the 

proposed system.  If algal production is predicted to
 be low, generally characterized by chlorophyll-a 
concentrations less than 5 mg/m
3
, then the potential for stratificati
on in a waterbody is low, and if it 
develops, it will occur in relatively deep portions 
of the water column.  The stratification potential 
increases substantially as chlorophyll-a concentr
ations increase above these values. If total 
phosphorus concentrations in a waterbody are 
known or can be estimated, the corresponding 
chlorophyll-a concentration can be calculated.  
Dillon and Rigler (19974) proposed the following 
empirical relationship between chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus, based on data collected primarily 

from northern temperate lakes: 

 

 
 
log (Chyl-a)   =   1.449   log  TP   -   1.136                             (Eq. 2) 
 
 

where: 

 

 

 TP  = Mean total phosphorus concentration (
˛
g/l) 
 

 

 

 Once the anticipated algal production and chlor
ophyll-a values in the aquatic system have 
been determined, corresponding  Secchi  disk  depths
  can  be  estimated 
 based  upon  a second 
empirical  relationship presented by Dillon and Rigl
er (1974), also based on data collected primarily 
from northern temperate lakes, which results in an estimated Secchi disk depth in meters, based upon 

a chlorophyll-a input in units of mg/m
3
 according to the following equation: 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
6-46 
 
where: 
 

 SD  = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

 Chyl-a =Chlorophyll-aconcentration(mg/m
3
) 
 

 

 

The Secchi disk is a simple device used to estimate 
water clarity in a lake or pond.  It consists of a 
weighted circular plate, 20 cm in diameter, with 
the surface painted with alternating black and white 
quarters.  The depth to which this disk can be seen in the water column is defined as the Secchi disk 

depth.  The Secchi disk depth in 
a body of water is generally assumed to correspond to a water depth 
where the available light is approximately 10-15% of the incident light at the water surface. 

 

 Although the general relationships referenced previously between total phosphorus, 

chlorophyll-a, and Secchi disk were developed prim
arily from data generated on northern temperate 
lakes, these equations have been utilized extensiv
ely within the State of Florida to model water 
quality characteristics in lakes.  However, for 
purposes of evaluating wet detention pond design, a 
revised evaluation of these relationships was 
conducted based specifically on water quality data 
colleted within the State of Florida.  As a sour
ce of data, the STORET database was searched for 
existing surface water data which includes simultaneous measurements for total phosphorus, 

chlorophyll-a, and Secchi disk for waterbodies with
in the State of Florida.  This data search 
generated in excess of 65,000 measurements whic
h include the three evaluated parameters. 
Unfortunately, this dataset exceeds the input capabilities for most commonly used statistical 

programs.  As a  result, average values were 
calculated for each monitoring location over the period 
of record contained within the STORET database.  Th
ese mean values were used to form a separate 
database which contained approximately 2467 individual 
data points.  This dataset was then used to 
perform regression analyses to evaluate relati
onships between total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, and 
Secchi disk specifically for Florida conditions. 

 

 A regression analysis was conducted to evaluate
 the most significant functional forms for the 
relationships between chlorophyll-a and total phosphor
us.  This evaluation indicated that a log-log 
relationship, similar to that expressed as Eq. 2, provides the best-fit between these parameters.  This 

regression analysis was evaluated for outliers by ex
amination of the Student T residuals and Cook™s 
D values.  Approximately 327 data points were elimin
ated from the data set as outliers during this 
process.  The remaining data set contained 2140 data points.   

 

 The best-fit relationship between chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus is summarized below:  

 

 

 
  ln (chyl-a)  =  1.058  ln  (TP)  -  0.934               R
2
  =  0.815

where: 

 

 chyl-a = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 
 TP = total phosphorus concentration (
g/l) 
 

 

The best-fit relationship obtained with Florida data 
is similar to that originally proposed by Dillon 
and Rigler (1974) with different co
efficients and intercepts.  The R
2
 value for this relationship is 
0.815 which indicates that the value of total 
phosphorus explains approximately 82% of the 
variability in measured chlorophyll-a concentrations
.  This relationship can be used to estimate 
chlorophyll-a concentrations in the a detention 
pond based upon estimated concentrations of total 
phosphorus. 

  

 Predictive relationships between Secchi disk 
depth and chlorophyll-a were also evaluated 
based upon the Florida lakes data set.  A regression 
analysis for this relationship was also conducted 
to identify the best-fit relationship between the two 
variables.  A plot of the relationship between 
Secchi disk depth and chlorophyll-a for Florida lake
s is given in Figure 6-14.  The best-fit equation 
for  this  relationship  is  a  hyperbolic  e
quation  which  is summari
zed on Figure 6-14.  The R
2
 
value  of  0.807  for this relationship indicates th
at chlorophyll-a explains approximately 81% of the 
variability in Secchi disk depth within a waterbody in
 Florida.  This relationship may be used to 
estimate the Secchi disk depth in a waterbody based on measured or calculated values of 

chlorophyll-a.

 Development of stratification and anoxic c
onditions in a non-colored waterbody, such as a 
wet detention pond, is directly related to th
e amount of algal production and the corresponding 
Secchi disk depth within the water column.  
Although algal production adds oxygen in areas where 
active photosynthesis occurs, algal cells also absorb
 solar radiation and limit the amount of sunlight 
and corresponding algal productivity at deeper depths within the water column.  Wet detention 

ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited systems.  
Since algal production is limited primarily by 
inputs of total phosphorus, phosphorus is also an im
portant variable in determining the depth of 
anoxia. 
 
 A linear regression was developed to predict th
e depth of anoxia in a waterbody as a function 
of ambient concentrations of ch
lorophyll-a, total phosphorus, and Secchi disk depth.   The depth of 
anoxia was obtained from field measured dissolved
 oxygen profiles collected in a waterbody at the 
time of sample collection for laboratory analyses. 
 A data set was develope
d containing 426 sets of 
measurements of Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, 
total phosphorus, and depth of anoxia, defined as 
dissolved oxygen concentrations less than 1 mg/l, for waterbodies in Central and South Florida.  The 

data were generated from field monitoring and 
laboratory analyses conducted by ERD over the past 
20 years.  The data set was evaluated for outliers
 by examination of the Student T residuals and 
Cook™s D values.  A total of 54 
data points was eliminated as outliers.  Both linear and log 
transformations were performed on the variables to
 obtain the ﬁbest-fitﬂ model which maximizes R
2
 
while minimizing the mean square error (MSE).  
This modeling exercise is designed to maximize 
the predictability of the model rather than to examine functional forms.  The resulting linear 

regression relationship for the variables indicates th
at the depth of anoxia is regulated primarily by 
Secchi disk depth according to the following relationship: 

 

 
   Anoxic Depth = 3.035  x  Secchi Disk Depth (m) Œ 0.004979 
(Eq. 5) 
 
 x  Total P (

) 
     
 
 
R

  =  0.951 
 
where: 

 

 Anoxic Depth = depth of anoxia (m) 

 

 

 

The above equation is valid for:  0.25 m  <  anoxic depth  <  9.0 m 

      0.09 m  <  Secchi disk depth < 3.49 m

 If the Secchi disk depth, total phosphorus, and 
chlorophyll-a for a proposed wet detention pond can
 be estimated based upon the relationships 
summarized previously, then the depth of anoxia can 
be estimated using Eq. 5.  This depth of anoxia 
would be an estimate of the maximum depth to 
which the wet detention pond could be constructed 
without generating anoxic conditions in lower portions of the water column.

The required dry retention depth is 
obtained by iterat

 CN values between 80 and 90.  The 
required dry retention depth = 1.

 from Table 6-1 (Zon

between DCIA percentages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values between 80 
and 90.  The required dry re
tention depth = 0.96 inches
 over the developed area.

would be slightly different due to differences

 from Table 6-1 (Zon

between DCIA percentages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values between 80 
and 90.  The required dry re
tention depth = 1.66 inches
 over the developed area.
 
 

 

 
2. WetDetention
 
 

 Treatment Train Approach
 
 
Calculati on of desi gn cri t eria for a wet deten
tion pond is based on determining the detention 
time required to achieve the 
desired pollutant removal efficiency of 80%.  For practical 
purposes, this efficiency is 
assumed to apply to nitrogen
 and phosphoru
s since other 
pollutants such as BOD and TSS ar
e typically removed at a faster
 rate than nutrients.  As 
discussed i n Secti on 5.2.2, wet detenti on syst
ems are capable of prov
iding a nnual ma ss load 
reduction for phosphorus in 
excess of 80% at extended detention times (> 200 days). 
However, wet detention ponds ar
e not capable of providing 80%
 removal for total nitrogen 
since removal efficiency for total nitrogen in
 wet detention ponds appears to peak at 
appr oximately 40- 45%.  
 
Therefore, when wet detention is desired as
 a treatment option, pr
e-treatment must be 
provided to enhance the total 
system performance efficiency 
to a minimum of 80% for total 
nitrogen.  Since dry retention provides the 
best pre-treatment in
 a minimal space, dry 
retention ap pears to be the pre-treatment system
 of choice for this application.  Ther e are 
many combinations of dry rete
ntion and wet detention which can provi de the desired 80% 
removal. 
 
Assume that a wet detention 
pond is designed with a 
residence time of 200 days.

Although the wet detention po

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18.75% of develope d area  

  

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4

From Appendix D (Zone 1), the required removal ef
ficiency of 65.0% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.75 and 1.00 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.75 inch, the treat
ment efficiency is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co

For a dry retention depth of 1.00 inch, the treat
ment efficiency is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 70.5%
. 
 
By iterating between 0.75 inch (63.4%) and 1.00 inch (70.5%), the dry retention depth required to 
achie ve  65.0% re mova
l is 0.81 inch.

Based on the relationships given in Figures 5-9 an

encies for TN and TP 
increase very little at detention 
times in excess of 
200 days.  Although 
the pond size may be 
increased (if desired) for fill or 
other purposes, the required dry re
tention pre-treatment depth will 
not be significantly reduced.  Ho
wever,  if the pond residence ti
me is decreased below 200 days, 
then the dry retention pre-treatment
 depth will increas
e correspondingly. 
 
 

 

 
2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic
s of the wet detention 
pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 
 
a. Calculateannualru
noff inputs to pond
 
 
The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 1). 
 

 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81. 4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously. 
 

 Annual C Value = 0.304 

 

 The annual r ainfall for the Pensacol
a area = 65.5 inches
 (Appendix A.3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 65.5 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.304 = 149.34 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 65.0% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 65. 0% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 149.34 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.650) = 52.27 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 200-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  52.27 ac-ft/yr  x  1 year/365 days
  x  200 days 
 =   28.64 ac-ft

If the proposed pond de pth e xc eeds the e s
timated anoxic zone depth of 12.2 ft, 
aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 12.2 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or

As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage

If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept

nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia. 
 

 
 
 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 12

From Appendix D (Zone 2), the required removal ef

achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.25 and 0.50 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.50 inch, the treat

DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co

for the project co

. 
 
By iterating between 0.25 inch (49.0%) and 0.50 inch (65.7%), the dry retention depth required to

The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 2). 
 

 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.253 

 

 The annual rainfall fo

 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 50.0 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1

 6. Calculate depth of an

  Using the relationship expres

anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 

 
Depth of  DO < 1 = 3.035  x  Secchi  + 0.02
164 (chyl-a)  Œ  0.
004979  x  Total P

   Secchi   = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

   chyl-a   = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

   Total P   = total phosphorus concentration (

Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035 
(1.15)  +  0.02164 (20.5)  
-  0.004979 (42)  =  3.73 m
  =  12.2 ft
 
 
 

 
If the pr oposed pond depth exceeds the estimated photic zone depth of 12.2 ft, 

aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 12.2 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the 
wat er col umn t o t he maxi mum pond dept

system should be selected by a qualified aeration specialist. 
 
As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage

If the pond is modified, based

 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 12

From Appendix D (Zone 3), the required removal ef

achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.75 and 1.00 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.75 inch, the treat

DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee

for the project conditions is 65.0%
.  There is no need to conduc

 For: DCIA = 18.75%and non-DCIA CN = 81.4 

 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.266 

 

 The annual rainfall for the Key West

   Secchi   = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

   chyl-a   = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

   Total P   = total phosphorus concentration (
g/l) 
 

 

 
Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035 
(1.15)  +  0.02164 (20.5)  
-  0.004979 (42)  =  3.73 m
  =  12.2  ft
 
    
 
 

If the pr oposed pond depth exceeds the estimated photic zone depth of 12.2 ft, 

aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 12.2 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the 
wat er col umn t o t he maxi mum pond dept
h.  The specific design of the required 
system should be selected by a qualified aeration specialist. 
 
As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
vol ume for collect
ed solids.   
 
If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept
h of anoxia to demo
nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia. 
 

 

 
 
 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 12
.2 ft x 2/3 = 8.13 ft 
 

 Pond surface area = pond
 volume/mean depth = 15.30 
ac-ft/8.13 ft = 1.88 ac

Calculate Treatment Requirements 
for 95% Removal (OFW Criteria)
 
 
 

Estimation of treatment requirements assumes th
at only dry retention 
and wet detention are 
capable of approaching the 
95% pollutant reduction goal. 
 

 
1. DryRetention
 
 

 
A. Pensacola Project (Zone 1)
 
 
The required retention depth 
to achieve an annual removal efficiency of 95% in 
Zone 1 is determined from Table 6-4 (Z
one 1) based on DCIA percentage and the 
non-DCIA CN value.  For this project: 
 

   DCIA Percentage = 18.75% of developed area 

 

   Non-DCIA CN = 81.4 

 
The required dry retention depth is 
obtained by iterat
ing between DCIA 
percentages of 10 and 20, and for non-DCIA
 CN values between 80 and 90.  The 
required dry retention depth = 3.
66 inches over the developed area.
 
 
 
 
B. Orlando Project (Zone 2)
 
 
If the project was located in Orlando, th
e required dry rete ntion depth would be  
slightly different due to diffe
rences in the distribution of rain events.  The required 
retention depth would be 
obtained from Table 6-4 (Zone
 2) by iterating between 
DCIA percentages of 10 and 
20, and for non-DCIA CN values between 80 and 90. 
The requir ed dr y retention depth = 2.

2. WetDetention
 
 

 Treatment Train Approach
 
 
Calculati on of desi gn cri t eria for a wet deten
tion pond is based on determining the detention 
time required to achieve the 
desired pollutant removal efficiency of 95%.  For practical 
purposes, this efficiency is 
assumed to apply to nitrogen
 and phosphoru
s since other 
pollutants such as BOD and TSS are typically re
moved at a faster rate than nutrients.  
However, as discussed in Section 5.2.2, wet 
det ention systems are incapabl e of providi ng 
95% annual mass load reduction for either 
nitroge n or phosphorus, e ven at e xte nde d 
dete ntion time s (> 200 days).   
 
Therefore, when wet detention is desired as
 a treatment option, pr
e-treatment must be 
provided to enhance the total 
system performance efficiency 
to a minimum of 95% for both 
total nitrogen and total p
hos phorus.  Since dry retention prov
ides the best pr
e-treatment in a 
minimal space, dry retention ap
pears to be the pre-treatment 
system of choice for this 
application.  There are many 
combinations of dry retentio
n and wet detention which can 
provide the desired 95% removal. 
 
Assume that a wet detention 
pond is designed with a 
residence time of 100 days. 
 

 

Anticipated TN removal (Figure 5-11) = 
 
Anticipated TP removal (Figure 5-10) = 

 
Eff = 40.13 + 6.372 ln (t
d
) + 0.213 (ln t
d
)
2
 = 40.13 + 6.372 ln 
(100) + 0.213 (ln 100)
2
 = 70.5% 
 

 

 
Based on the estimated per for mance ef ficiency 
of the wet detention po
nd, the pond fails to 
meet the 95% remo val criteria for 
either TN or TP.  Therefore,
 the remaining efficiency is 
achieved using dry detention.  The required effici
ency for the dry reten
tion is calculated b y  
Eq. 1 below:

2A.    PENSACOLA  
(ZONE  1)  PROJECT
 
 
 

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the 
development characteristics: 

 

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18. 75% of develope d area  

  

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 1), the required removal ef
ficiency of 94.7% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
3.50 and 3.75 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 3.50 
inches, the treatment efficiency 
is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 94.3%
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 3.75 
inches, the treatment efficiency 
is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 95.1%
. 
 
By iterating between 3.50 inches (94.3%) and 3.75 
inches (95.1%), the dry retention depth required 
to achieve 94.7% rem
oval is 3.72 inches.

2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic
s of the wet detention 
pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 
 
a. Calculateannualru
noff inputs to pond
 
 
The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 1). 
 

 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.304 

 

 The annual r ainfall for the Pensacol
a area = 65.5 inches
 (Appendix A.3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 65.5 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.304 = 149.34 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 94.7% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 94.7% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 149.34 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.947) = 7.92 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 100-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  7.92 ac-ft/ yr  x  1 
year/365 days  x  10
0 days  =  2.17 ac-ft 
 

 

 

 
b. Estimate maximum allowable pond depth
 
 
The maximum allowable pond depth is directly re
lated to the anticipated
 algal productivity 
within the pond.  Ass uming that wet dete
ntion ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited 
ecosystems, the productivity 
ca n be e stimate d based on the me an TP c once ntration.  
 

 
1. Estimaterunoff

For a single-family residentia
l land use, the event mean 
concentrati on (emc) for TP 
in runoff can be obtain
ed from Table 4-17: 
 

 TP = 0.327 mg /l (singl
e-family residential)

2. Calculate TP loading to wet detention pond
 
 

After  the  dry retention pre-treatment, th
e annual runoff input to the pond = 7.92   
ac-ft/yr 
 

 
  TP load to pond = 

 
 
 
3. Calculate TP concentration in pond
 
 
At the proposed 100- day residence time, 
the TP removal was pr
eviously estimated 
as 70.5% . 
 

  Annual mass of TP remaining in water column = 

 

   3.19 kg TP/yr  x  (1 
Œ 0.705)  =  0.94 kg TP/yr 
 
The remaining TP mass will be
 distributed between the po
nd volume and the annual 
outflow: 
 

   = 2.17 ac-fat  +  7.

 6. Calculate depth of an

  Using the relationship expres

anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 
 
Depth of DO < 1 = 3.035   x  S

For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond

 Mean pond depth = 9.6 ft x 2/3 = 6.40 ft 

 

 Pond surface area = pond

2B.    ORLANDO  (ZONE  2)  PROJECT
 
 

 

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the 
development characteristics:

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 2), the required removal ef
ficiency of 94.7% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
2.25 and 2.00 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.25 
inches, the treatment efficiency 
is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project conditions is 94.8
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.00 
inches, the treatment efficiency 
is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project conditions is 92.4
. 
 
By iterating between 2.00 inches (92.4%) and 2.25

A. Calculateannualru

The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Orlando). 
 

 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.253 

 

 The annual rainfall fo

inches (Appendix A. 3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 50.0 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.253 = 94.88 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 94.7% for the dr

the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc

into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo

 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 94.88 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.947) = 5.03 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 100-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  5.03 ac-ft/ yr  x  1 
year/365 days  x  10
0 days  =  1.38 ac-ft

5. Calculate mean Secchi disk depth
 
 

  The relationship between chlorophyll-

wat erbody i s expressed by 
the following relationship: 
 
 
where:  SD = Secchi dis k depth (m) 

 
chyl-a = chlorophyll-a (mg/m
3
) 
 

 
 
 

 6. Calculate depth of an
oxic conditions in pond
 
 
  Using the relationship expres
sed in Eq. 5, the depth of 
anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 

 
Depth of DO < 1 = 3.035   x  S
ecchi  +  0.02164   x  (chyl-
a)  Œ  0.004979
  x  Total P 
 

 
  where: 

 

   Depth of DO < 1 = anoxic depth (m) 

 

   Secchi   = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

   chyl-a   = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

   Total P   = total phosphorus concentration (
g/l) 
 

 

 
Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035 
(0.81)  +  0.02164 (38.4)  - 
 0.004979 (76)  =  2.91  m
  =  9.5 ft
 
    
 

 
If the proposed pond depth 
exceeds the estimated photic
 zone depth of 9.5 ft, 
aeration or other mixing will be required fo
r areas deeper than 9.
5 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the 
wat er col umn t o t he maxi mum pond dept
h.  The specific design of the required 
system should be selected by a qualified aeration specialist.

As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
volume for collected solids.  

 

If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept
h of anoxia to demo
nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia. 
 

 

 
 
 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 9.5 ft x 2/3 = 6.36 ft 

 

 Pond surface area = pond
 volume/mean depth = 1.38 ac-ft/6.36 ft = 0.22 ac 
 

 

 

 

 

 
2C.    KEY  WEST  
(ZO NE  3)  PROJECT
 
 
 

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the 
development characteristics: 

 

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18. 75% of develope d area  

  

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 3), the required removal ef
ficiency of 94.7% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth in ex
cess of 4 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 4.00 
inches, the treatment efficiency 
is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 93.8%
. 
 

The maximum retention depth of 4 inches listed in
 Appendix D fail
s to reach the required removal 
efficiency of 94.7% for t he retenti on porti on of the 
treatment train.  Since 
increasing the detention 
time of the wet detention 
pond will not significantly 
enhance the efficiency of the system, it is not 
possible to achieve the goal of 95% pollutant remo
val for both total nitrogen and total phosphorus 
for Zone 3 conditio
ns without involving 
unreasonable dry rete
ntion requirements.

Determine the water quality treatment requi
rements for a 100-acre proposed single-family 
residential site.  Perform separate calculations for identical projects located in Pensacola (Zone 

1), Orlando (Zone 2), and Key 
West (Zone 3).  A summary of pre- and post-development 
conditions is given below. 

 

 
Calculate Pre- and Post-Development Conditions
 
 
Pre-Development Conditions
 
 
1. LandUse
: 90 acres - mixture of rangel
and/forest (fair condition) 
10 acres Œ isolated hardwood wetlands 
 

 
2. Ground Cover/Soil Types
: Rangeland/Forest Œ Hydr
ologic Soil Group (HSG) D 
Wetland Œ hydric soils 
 

 
3. ImperviousAreas
: 
0% impervious, 0% Directly Connected Impervious Area (DCIA) 
 

 
4. Estimation of Pre-Development Loadings
:  The total project site covers 100 acres, 
including 90 acres of rangeland/
forest and 10 acres of wetlands
.  Five acres of the on-site 
wetlands will be preserved and 5 acres will be incorporated into the project. 
 

 
A. Pre-Development Runoff Volume
 
 
(1)
 
Rangeland/Forest
:  From TR-55, the CN for 
rangeland (fair condition) in 
HSG D soils is 84 and the CN for fore
st areas (woods) is 82.  Assuming a 
50-50 mixture of rangeland and forest, the composite CN is: 
 

   Composite CN = 84 (rangeland)  x  0.5  +  82 (forest)  x  0.5  =  83 

 
From Appendix C, the annual runoff co
efficient for DCIA = 0 and CN = 
83 can be estimated by interpolation: 
 

    Pensacola (Zone 1) = 0.197 

    Orlando (Zone 2) = 0.140 

    Key West (Zone 3)= 0.159 

 

   

   From Appendix A.3, the annual 
rainfall depths for the 3 sites are: 
 

    Pensacola = 65.5 in/yr 

    Orlando = 50.0 in/yr 

    Key We st = 40.0 in/yr 

 

  

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
7-30 
 
 

   Annual runoff volumes
 for the 3 sites are: 
 

    Pensacola: 
 

90 acres x 65.5 in/yr x 1 ft/12 in x 0.197 = 96.78 ac-ft/yr
 
 

 
    Orlando: 

 

     90 acres x 50.0 in/yr x 1 ft/12 in x 0.140 = 52.5 ac-ft/yr
 
 

 
Key West: 
 

     90 acres x 40.0 in/yr x 1 ft/12 in x 0.159 = 47.7 ac-ft/yr
 
 

 
 
 

(2) Isolated Hardwood Wetland
:  
From TR-55, the CN for wooded areas 
(fair condition) in hydric 
soils (HSG D) is 82. 
 

 From Appendix C, the annual runoff 
coefficient for DCIA = 0 and CN = 
82 can be estimated by interpolation: 
 
Pensacola (Zone 1) = 0.185 
    Orlando (Zone 2) = 0.142 

    Key West (Zone 3)= 0.159 
 

 

 Based on a review of the site cond
itions (including wetland indicators and 
water level data) by the project biologi
st and engineer, it was determined 
that approximately 75% of the genera
ted runoff volume is retained in the 
wetland and 25% leaves the wetland as 
runoff.  Of the 10 acres of on-site 
wetlands, 5 acres will be preserved and 
5 acres will be incorporated into 
the development.  Calculations are 
conducted only for the 5 acres to be 
altered, since the remaining 5 acr
es will have the same loading 
characteristics under pre- and post-conditions. 
 

 

 Annual runoff export from the 5-acre wetland areas are: 

 
Pensacola: 
 
5 acres  x  65.5 in/yr  x  1 ft/12 in  x  0.185  x  0.25  =  1.26 ac-ft
 
 

 
   Orlando: 

 

    5 acres  x  50.0 in/yr  x  1 ft/12 in  x  0.131  x  0.25  =  0.68 ac-ft
 
 
 
Key West: 
 

    5 acres  x  40.0 in/yr  x  1 ft/12 in  x  0.149  x  0.25  =  0.62 ac-ft

Calculate Treatment Requirements for Post
- Less Than or Equal to Pre-Loadings
 
 
Estimation of treatment requirements assumes th
at only dry retention 
and wet detention are 
capable of approaching the desi
red pollutant reduction goal. 
 

 
1. DryRetention:
   For dry retention, the removal effi
ciencies for TN and TP are identical 
since the removal efficiency is based on th
e portion of the annual runoff volume which is 
infiltrated.  The required removal is the larg
er of the calculated removal efficiencies for 
TN and TP. 
 

 
A. PensacolaProject:
   
For the Pensacola area, the annual load reduction is 63.2% 
for total nitrogen and 89.0% for total phos
phorus.  The design criteria is based on 
the largest required removal which is 89.
0%.  The required retention depth to 
achieve an annual removal efficiency 
of 89.0% in the Pensacola area is 
determined from Appendix D (Zone 1) 
based on DCIA percentage and the non-
DCIA CN value.  For this project: 
 

   DCIA Percentage = 18.75% of developed area 

 

   Non-DCIA CN = 81.4 

 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 1), th
e required removal efficiency of 89.0% is achieved 
with a dry retention depth between 2.50 and 2.75 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.50 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 88.9%
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.75 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 91.0%
. 
 
By iterating between 2.50 inches (88.9%) an
d 2.75 inches (91.0%
), the dry retention 
depth required to achieve 89
.0% removal is 2.51 inches.
 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

B. OrlandoProject
:  
 For the Orlando area, the annual load reduction is 68.5% for 
total nitrogen and 90.5% for total phosphorus
.  The design criteria is based on the 
largest required removal which is 90.5%.  
If the project was lo
cated in Orlando, th e 
required dr y retention depth would be sligh
tly different due to 
differences in the 
distribution of rain events.  The required
 retention depth would be obtained fro m  
Appendix D (Zone 2) by iterating between 
DCIA percentages of 10 and 20, and for 
non-DCIA CN values between 80 and 90.  
 
From Appendix D (Zone 2), th
e required removal efficiency of 86.8% is achieved 
with a dry retention depth between 1.50 and 1.75 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 1.75 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 91.25%
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 1.50 inch, the tre atment e ffic ienc y is obtaine d by 

iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 88.9%
. 
 
By iterating betwee n 1.50 in
ch (88.9%) and 1.75 inches (91.25%), the dry retention 
depth required to achieve 91
.0% removal is 1.72 inches.
 
 

 

 

 

 
C. KeyWestProject:
For the Key West area, th
e annual load reduction is 61.4% 
for total nitrogen and 88.4% for total phos
phorus.  The design criteria is based on 
the largest required removal which is 88.4%.  If the project was located in Key 

West, the required dry retention depth would 
be slightly differ ent due to differ ences 
in the distribution of rain events.  The 
required retention depth would be obtained 
from Appendix D (Zone 3) by iterati ng be
twee n DCIA pe rce ntages of 10 and 20,  
and for non-DCIA CN values
 between 80 and 90.   
 
From Appendix D (Zone 3), th
e required removal efficiency of 88.4% is achieved 
with a dry retention depth between 2.50 and 2.75 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.75 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 88.55%
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.50 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10

efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 87.61%
. 
 
By iterating between 2.50 inches (87.6%) and 2.75 inches (88.55%), the dry 
retention depth required to achieve 88.4% removal is 2.71 inches.

2. WetDetention
 
 

 Treatment Train Approach
 
 
Calculati on of desi gn cri t eria for a wet deten
tion pond is based on determining the detention 
time required to 
achieve the post- <
 pre-pollutant removal effi ci
encies for TN and TP listed 
previously.  For practical purposes, this effi
ciency is assumed to 
apply to nitrogen and 
phosphorus since other pollutant
s such as BOD and TSS are t
ypically removed 
at a faster 
rate than nutrients.  As disc
uss ed in Section 5.2.2, wet de
tention systems are capable of 
providing a nnual ma ss loa d re duc tions for 
phosphorus in excess 
of 80% at extended 
detention times (> 200 days), but
 the removal efficiency for to
tal nitrogen in
 wet detention 
ponds appears to peak at approximately 45%.  As
 a result, wet detentio
n alone is not capable 
of achieving the requir
ed efficiencies of 88.4-90.5% 
for TP an d 6 1.4
-68.5% for TN. 
 
Therefore, when wet detention is desired as
 a treatment option, pr
e-treatment must be 
provided to enhance th
e total system performance efficien
cy to the minimum efficiencies 
necessar y to achieve post- <
 pre-loadings for TN and TP.  
Since dry retention provides the 
best pre-trea tme nt in a minimal spac e , dry rete
ntion appears to be the pre-treatment system 
of choice for this application.
  There are many 
combinations of dry retention and wet 
detention which can provid
e the desired removals. 
 
Assume that the primary compon
ent in the treatment train will 
be a wet detention pond with 
a residence time  of 150 days. 
 

 

Anticipated TN removal (Figure 5-10) = 
 
 
Anticipated TP removal (Figure 5-9) = 
 
Eff = 40.13 + 6.372 ln (t

 = 40.13 + 6.372 ln

2A.    PENSACOLA  
(ZONE  1)  PROJECT
 
 
 
Since a wet  detent ion p
ond cannot meet both the 89.0% remo
val criteria for TP and the 63.2% 
removal for TN, the remaining effici
ency is achi eved using dry rete
ntion.  The design of the dry 
retention pond is dictate d by the re quired re moval for TN sinc e this is whe re the largest deficit exists 

betwee n the required re moval and 
the removal provided by the wet 
detention pond.  The required 
efficiency for the dry retention 
is calculated by Eq. 1 below:

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the 
development characteristics: 

 

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18. 75% of develope d area  

  

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 1), the required removal ef
ficiency of 36.0% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.00 and 0.25 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.25 inch, the treat
ment efficiency is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 38.0%
. 
 
By iterating between 0.25 inch (38.0%) and 0.00 inch (0.00%), the dry retention depth required to 
achie ve  36. 0% re mova
l is 0.24 inch.
 
 

Therefor e, the requir ed tr eat
ment train will consist of: 
 

a.
 
0.24 inch dr y retention, followed by 
b.
 
Wet detention pond with a 1
50-day mean residence time 
 
Based on the relationships given in Figures 5-9 an
d 5-10, the removal effici
encies for TN and TP 
increase little at dete
ntion times in  excess of 100-150 days
.  Although the pond size may be 
increased (if desired) for fill or 
other purposes, the required dry re
tention pre-treatment depth will 
not be significantly reduced.  Ho
wever, if the pond residence ti
me is decreased below 150 days, 
then the dry retention pre-treatment
 depth will increas
e correspondingly. 
 

 

 

 
2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic
s of the wet detention 
pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 
 
a. Calculateannualru
noff inputs to pond
 
 
The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 1). 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
7-41 
 

 
 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.304 

 

 The annual r ainfall for the Pensacol
a area = 65.5 inches
 (Appendix A.3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 65.5 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.304 = 149.3 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 36.0% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 36.0% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 149.3 ac-ft/yr  
x  (1 - 0.360) = 95.55 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 150-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  95.55 ac-ft/yr  x  1 year/365 days
  x  150 days 
 =   39.27 ac-ft 
 

 

 

 
b. Estimate maximum allowable pond depth
 
 
The maximum allowable pond depth is directly re
lated to the anticipated
 algal productivity 
within the pond.  Ass uming that wet dete
ntion ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited 
ecosystems, the productivity 
ca n be e stimate d based on the me an TP c once ntration.  
 

 
1. Estimaterunoff

For a single-family residentia
l land use, the event mean 
concentrati on (emc) for TP 
in runoff can be obtain
ed from Table 4-16: 
 

 TP = 0.327 mg /l (singl
e-family residential) 
 

 

 

 
2. Calculate TP loading to wet detention pond
 
 

After  the  dry retention pre-treatment, th
e annual runoff input 
to the pond = 95.55

3. Calculate TP concentration in pond
 
 
At the proposed 150- day residence time, 
the TP removal was pr
eviously estimated 
as 77.4% . 
 

  Annual mass of TP remaining in water column = 

 

   38.53 kg TP/yr  x  (1

This mass will be distribute

and the pond outflow.   Assu
ming that inflow and outflo

4. Calculate mean chloroph

The relationship between TP and chlorophy
ll-a in a Florida waterbody is expresse d 
by the following relationship: 
 

     ln (chyl -a)  =  1.058 l n
 (TP)  -  0.934   (Eq. 4) 
 
 
  

  where:  chyl-a =  chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

    TP = total P concentration (
g/l) 
 

 
ln (chyl -a)  =  1.058

 6. Calculate depth of an
oxic conditions in pond
 
 
  Using the relationship expres
sed in Eq. 5, the depth of 
anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 

 
 
Depth of DO < 1 = 3.035  x  Secchi + 0.0216
4  x  (chyl-a) Œ 0.004979  x  Total P 
 

 
  where: 

 

   Depth of DO < 1 = anoxic depth (m) 

 

   Secchi   = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

   chyl-a   = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

   Total P   = total phosphorus concentration (
g/l) 
 

 

 
Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035 
(1.01)  +  0.02164 (25.7)  
-  0.004979 (52)  =  3.37 m
  =  11.1 ft
 
    
 
If the proposed pond de pth e xc eeds the e s
timated anoxic zone depth of 11.1 ft, 
aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 11.1 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the 
wat er col umn t o t he maxi mum pond dept
h.  The specific design of the required 
system should be selected by a qualified aeration specialist. 
 
As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
vol ume for collect
ed solids.   
 
If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept
h of anoxia to demo
nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia.

For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond

 Mean pond depth = 11

From Appendix D (Zone 2, the re

retention depth between 
0.00 and 0.25 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.25 inch, the treat

2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic
s of the wet detention 
pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 
 
A. Calculateannualru
noff inputs to pond
 
 
The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 2). 
 

 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.253 

 

 The annual rainfall fo
r th e Orlando area = 50.0 
inches (Appendix A. 3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 50.0 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.253 = 94.88 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 45.2% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 45.2% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 94.88 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.452) =  51.99 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 150-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  51.99 ac-ft/yr  x  1 year/365 days
  x  150 days 
 =   21.37 ac-ft 
 
 

 
 
B. Estimatemaximum 
all owable pond depth
 
 
The maximum allowable pond depth is directly re
lated to the anticipated
 algal productivity 
within the pond.  Ass uming that wet dete
ntion ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited 
ecosystems, the productivity 
ca n be e stimate d based on the me an TP c once ntration.  
 
 
1. Estimaterunoff

For a single-family residential land use, th
e emc for TP in runoff can be obtained 
from Table 4-17:  

 

 TP = 0.327 mg /l (singl
e-family residential)

2. Calculate TP loading to wet detention pond
 
 

After  the  dry retention pre-treatment, th
e annual runoff input 
to the pond = 51.99 
ac-ft/yr 
 
  TP load to pond = 
 
 

 
3. Calculate TP concentration in pond
 
 
At the proposed 150- day residence time, 
the TP removal was pr
eviously estimated 
as 77.4% . 
 

  Annual mass of TP remaining in water column = 

 

   20.97 kg TP/yr  x  (1
 Œ 0.774)  =  4.74 kg TP/yr 
 

 
This  phosphorus  mass w
ill be distributed within the 
pond permanent pool (21.37 
ac-ft) and the pond outflow. 
 Assumi ng that inflow and 
outflow are approximately 
equal, the outflow w
ill be 51.99 ac-ft.

where:  SD = Secchi dis k depth (m) 

 
chyl-a = chlorophyll-a (mg/m

 6. Calculate depth of an
oxic conditions in pond
 
 
  Using the relationship expres
sed in Eq. 5, the depth of 
anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 

 
Depth of DO < 1 = 3.035  x  Secchi + 0.0216
4   x  (chyl-a) Œ 0.
004979  x  Total P 
 

 
  where: 

 

   Depth of DO < 1 = anoxic depth (m) 

 

   Secchi   = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

   chyl-a   = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

   Total P   = total phosphorus concentration (

Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035 
(1.01)  +  0.02164 (25.7)  
-  0.004979 (52)  =  3.36 m
  =  11.0 ft
 
    
 

 
If the pr oposed pond depth exceeds the estimated photic zone depth of 11.0 ft, 

aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 11.0 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the

As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
vol ume for collect
ed solids.   
 
If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept
h of anoxia to demo
nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia. 
 

 
 
 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 11
.0 ft x 2/3 = 7.3 ft  
 

 Pond surface area = pond
 volume/mean depth = 21.37 
ac- ft/7.3 ft = 2.91 ac

Since the wet detention p
ond fails to meet the 88
.4% removal criteria for TP
 and the 61.4% removal 
for TN, the remaining efficiency is achieved usin
g dry retention.   The design of the dry rete ntion 
pond is dictated by the required removal for TN sin
ce this is where the larges
t deficit exists between 
the required removal and the removal provided by th
e wet detention pond.  Th

for the dr y retention is calculated by Eq. 1 below:

from the tables given in Appendix D using the 
development characteristics: 

 

 

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18. 75% of develope d area

1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 3), the required removal ef
ficiency of 32.9% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.00 and 0.25 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.25 inch, the treat
ment efficiency is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 42.9%
. 
 
By iterating between 0.00 inch (0.0%) and 0.25 inch
 (42.9%), the dry retent
ion depth required to 
achie ve  32. 9% re mova
l is 0.19 inch.
 
 
Therefor e, the requir ed tr eat

The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 3). 
 

 
 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.266 

 

 The annual rainfall for the Key West
 area = 40.0 inches
 (Appendix A.3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 40.0 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.266 = 79.8 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 32.9% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 32.9% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo

 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond
 = 79.8 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.329) = 53.55 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 150-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  53.55 ac-ft/yr  x  1 year/365 days

 The design examples illustrated in the pr evious
 sections are intended 
to present alternative 
stormwater designs whic
h will meet both the 80% 
and 95% pollutant reduction goals outlined in 
Chapter 62-40 FAC as well 
as a condition of no net increase in
 pollutant loadings for a developed 
site under post-development cond

ovide calculations for treatment 
systems comprised exclusively of dry retention as 
well as a combination of 
wet detention with dry  
retention pre -treatme nt.  The hypothe tical site c ons
ists of a 100-acre rangeland/forest parcel which 
is converted into a single-family residential co

 A comparison of existing and proposed dry re

based upon the hypothetical 100-acre parcel, is give

Orla ndo, a nd Ke y West.  Existing require me nts fo

 As se en in Table 7-1, the  existing de sign crite
ria for dry retention in the Pensacola and Key 
West areas fall well short of the 
actual dry retention treatment vol
ume required to achieve an 80% 
annual pollutant r emoval ef fici
ency.  For a project designed in
 the Orlando area, based upon 
SJRWMD design criteria, the dry re
tention requirement for an off-line 
system would fail to meet the 
80% pollutant removal goal, while the pollutant re
moval goal would be ex
ceeded by an on-line 
retention system with 1.00
 inch of dry retention. 
 

 Exi sting and proposed dry retenti on requireme
nts are also provided fo
r developmen
ts which 
dischar ge to OFWs which are assumed to be de
signed according to the 95% pollutant reduction 
target goal outlined in Ch
apter 62- 40 FAC.  The applicable desi
gn criteria for e
ach of the three 
project areas is 50% additional dry retention tr
eatment volume above th
e amount necessary to 
achieve 80% pollutant removal.  For projects de
signed in the Pensacola and Key West areas, this 
treatment volume requirement become
s 0.75 inch.  If a 
development is constructed in the Orlando 
area,  the  current dry rete ntion re quire me nt bec omes 
0.75 inch for off-line sy
stems and 1.50 inch for 
on-li ne syst ems.  However, t he act ual dry retenti
on treatment requirements necessary to achieve a 
95% pollutant removal far exceed the existing dry 
retention treatment requirements.  Dry retention 
requirements for 95% pollutant removal are 3.66 inch
es for the Pensacola area,
 2.45 inches for the 
Orlando area, and 3.62 in ches
 for the Key West area.   
 

 Dry retention requirements 
necessary to achieve post <
 pre-development loadings are 
summarized at the bottom of
 Table 7-1.  The required removals 
necessary to achieve no net increase 
in loadings for total nitr
ogen range from 61.4-68.5%.  These va
lues indicate that a pollutant removal 
efficiency of 80% is not required fo
r total nitrogen to achieve no net 
increase in pollutant loadings.  
Required removal efficiencies for total phosphorus 
to achieve no net increase in pollu tant loadings 
range from 88.4-90.5% , suggesting that stormwat
er management systems designed for an 80%  
pollutant removal will fa
il to achieve post <
 pre-development loadings fo
r total phosphorus.  Based 
upon these values, it is apparent 
that a stormwater management sy
stem designed to achieve 80% 
pollutant removal will remove more 
than the required amount of tota
l nitrogen, while 
removing less 
than the required amount of total phosphorus.  
A stormwater management
 system designed to 
achieve a true 95% reduction in po
llutant loadings will re
move substantially mo
re total nitrogen and 
total phos phorus  than requ
ired to achieve post <
 pre-development loadings.   
 
 Based upon the comparative info
rmati on summari zed in Table 7-
1, it appears that designing 
stormwater management systems to
 achieve an arbitrary pollutant
 removal goal for both total 
nitrogen and total ph
osphorus is an ineffective 
method for achieving comp
liance with water quality 
or anti-degradation criteria.  A much more effe
ctive method of addressi
ng st ormwat er treat ment  
requirements appears to be designs based upon post <
 pre-development loadings.  The pr oposed dry 
retention requirements necessary 
to achieve this goal for the hypot
hetical  projects range from 1.67 
inches in the Orlando area to 2.42 inches in the 
Pensacola area.  These values are greater than the 
actual dry retention requirements necessary to 
achieve an 80% pollutant removal goal, but are 
substantially less than the dry retention requireme
nts necessary to achieve a 95% pollutant removal 
goal .  If post <
 pre-development criteria are utilized, th
ere would be no need for supplemental  
design criteria for discharges into OFWs since a
ll projects would result in
 no net increase in 
pollutant loadings into the recei
ving waterbody.  However, it should be noted that the post <
 pre-
development dry retention design criteria liste
d at the botto m of Table 7-1 are based upon th e 
removal efficiencies required for 
total phosphorus.  Since all cons
tituents are removed at the same 
rate using dry retentio
n, an excess removal would still be
 achieved for total nitrogen.

7.4.2 WetDetention
 
 
 A comparison of existing a
nd proposed wet detention stor mwater treatment requirements to 
achieve the evaluate
d design objectives is given in Tabl
e 7-2.  Under exis
ting conditions, wet 
detention systems designed in th
e Pensacola area according to FDEP
 design criter ia must have a 
treatment volume equivalent to 1.00
 inch of runoff over the project
 area.  The FDEP design criteria 
do not specify requirements for detention time.  
The project constructed in
 the Orlando area would 
be designed accor ding to SJRWMD cr
iteria.  These criteria specify a 
treatment volume of 1 inch of 
runoff, with a minimu m 14-day wet season detenti
on time and a maximum pond depth of 12 feet.  
The project constructed in the Key We st area 
would be designed acco
rding to SFWMD design 
criteria whic h specify a treatment 
volume of 1 inc h of runoff, with no spec ified detention time and 
25-50% of the pond depth gr
eater than 12 feet.   
 
 A summary of propose d we t dete ntion desi
gn criteria necessary 
to achieve the 80% 
pollutant removal goal is provided in Table 7-2.  
For this analysis, the trea
tment volume is assumed 
to be the same as under 
existi ng desi gn criteri a.  
Although this treatment vo
lume is often termed the 
ﬁwater qualityﬂ component of 
the system, it has very little imp
act on the overall performance 
efficiency of the system and prim
arily regulates the drawdown charact
eristics of the 
pond following 
a storm event.  The design example assumes a we
t detention pond wit h a 
detention pond of 150 
days since this design tends to maximize rem
oval effi ciencies for ni
trogen and phosphorus.  
However, lower dete ntion time s could also be
 used, although this would increas e treatment 
requirements for  other  portions of the over all tr eatment tr ain. 

 
 Although wet detention ponds ca n provide a re
moval  effici ency of 80
% or more for total 
phosphorus at extended detention 
times, wet detention ponds are not
 capable of providing an 80% 
pollutant removal for total nitrogen.
  As a result, r etention pre- treat
ment will be required to increase 
the overall performance efficiency 
of the system to 80% for to tal nitrogen.  Based on th e analyses 
presented in the previous sections
, this will require a dry retention 
pre-treatment of 
0.81 inch in the 
Pensacola area, 0.49 inch in the Orlando area, a
nd 0.75 inch in the Key West area.  Under the 
alternative design, the maximum 
depth for each pond is based 
upon predicted water quality 
characteri sti cs and t he anticipated depth of anoxi a
 within the pond rather 
than an arbitrary depth 
standard.  Ponds whic h ar
e constructed deeper than the anticipated depth of anoxia may require 
supplemental aeration or circulation to maintain ae
robic conditions.  It should be noted that, while 
this design will meet the 80% pollu
tant removal goal for total nitroge
n, the overall pollutant removal 
for total phosphorus will
 substantiall
y exceed 80% . 
 
 Wet detention design criteria to achieve a 95% pollutant removal ar e also summar ized in 

Table 7-2.  Under existing design criteria, the 
tr eatment volume would be increased by 50% for  
each of the three projects, while
 other component s of
 the wet detention 
pond woul
d remain 
unchanged.  Under the proposed alternative we
t detention design, the treatment volumes are 
assumed to be the same as those provided unde
r existing conditions since the treatment volumes 
have  little  impact  on  overall system performan
ce.  The example summarized in a previous section 
utilizes a 100-day detention pond, 
although other deten
tion times could be u
tilized as well.  The 
remaining dr y retention pre-treatment necessar y to 
boost the overall per f or ma
nce of the system to 
95% ranges fr om 2.42 inches in the Orlando area to
 greater than 4 inches in the Key West area.  
These relatively large dry retent
ion requirements are necessary 
primarily to boost the removal 
efficiency for total nitrogen to 
95%, while the removal efficien
cy for total ph
osphorus will 
substantiall
y exceed 95% .

 Proposed wet detenti on treat ment requirement s necessary to achieve post <

loadings  are  summarized at th
e bottom of Table 7-2.  These are 
the same values utilized in Table 
7-1.  A wet detention treatment train which will achieve post <

mplished using a wet detention pond 
with a 150-day detention time, with dry retention 
pre-treatme nt ranging from
 0.19- 0.24 inch.  The 
requirements necessary to achieve post <

e less than the requirements 
necessar y to achieve a tr ue 80% pollutant removal 
goal  si nce the elevat ed removal  efficienci es are 
no longer required for total nitrogen

7.5  Summary
 
 

 Based on the analyses provid
ed in  the previo us sections, it is apparent that the most 
appropriate method of developi
ng stormwater treatme
nt requirements is
 to utilize a post <
 pre-
development loading co nditions.  Developing stormw
ater design criteria to achieve an arbitrary 
80% pollutant removal goal will pr
ovide substantially higher than
 required removals for total 
nitrogen while providing total 
phosphorus removal s in excess of 80%.  Requi ring stormwater 
ma nageme nt systems to be
 designed to achieve an arbitrary 
95% pollutant removal goal will far 
exceed the required removals for both total nitrog
en and total phosphorus 
necessary to achieve a  
post <
 pre-development loadin
g, while resulting in substantially
 elevated stormwater treatment 
requireme nts and cost
s compared with existing conditions.

Computational P rocedures:
 
A climate normal is defined, b y co nvention, as the arithmetic 
mean of a climatological element 
computed over th ree c onsecutive 
decades 
(WMO,19 89). Ide ally, the  data r ecord for such a 3 0 - yea r pe riod 
should be free of a n y inconsistenc
ies in observational practices
 (
e.g
., changes in station 
location, instrumentation, time of observation, 
etc
.)  and be seriall y complete (
i.e
., no missing values). When present, in
consistencies can lead to a non -
climatic bias in one period of a st ation™
s record rel ative to another, yi elding an  ﬁinho mogeneousﬂ d at a record.   Adjust ments a
nd estimations can make a 
climate record ﬁh omogeneousﬂ an d serially comple te, and allo w a clim
ate normal to b e calculated simply as the averag e of the 30
 mo nt hly values. 
The method olog y emplo yed to ge nerate the 1971- 2000 norm als isnot 
the same as in previous nor
m als, as it addresses inhomogeneit
y and missing 
data value proble m s using several st
eps.  The tech nique developed b y Karl 
et al.
 ( 19 86) is used to adjust monthl
y ma ximum and minimum temperatu re 
observations of conterminous U.S . stations
 to a consistent midnight-to-midnight sche
dule.  All monthly temperatu re ave rages and
 p recipitation totals are 
cross-checked against archived daily obse rvati
ons to ensure inter n al consistency.  Ea
ch monthl y ob servation is evaluated using 
a mo dified quality 
control procedur e (Peterson 
et  al
.,1998), where st ation observation departu res are c omputed,
 compa red wi th neighbo r i ng stations, and then flagged and  
estimated where large differences wi th nei
gh boring values exist.  Miss
ing or discarded temperatu re and  precipitation observatio
ns are rep l aced using a 
weighting f unction derived from th e observ
ed relati onship bet ween a candidate™s monthl y 
observation s and those of up  to 20 neig
hbo
r
ing stations whose  
observations are most strongl y cor related wi th the c andidate site
.  Fo r temper ature est i mates, neighboring stations we re select
ed from the  U.S. 
Historical Climatolog y Net work (U SHCN; Karl 
et al.
 1990).   For p rec ipitation estimates, all avail
able stations we re pote n
tial neighbors, maximizing 
station density f o r estimating the more s
patially variable precipitation values.  
Peterson and Ea sterling (1994) a nd Easterling an d Peterson (1 995 ) 
outline the met hod for adjusting 
temperatu re inho mogeneities.
 This technique 
involvescomparing the recor d of t he candidate stat ion wi th a 
refer en c e series generat ed from neighb or ing data. The ref erence s
eries is reconstructed 
using a weight ed  average of firs
t difference observ ations (the diffe
r ence from one year to the 
next ) f or neighbo ring stations w
ith the highest correlation 
wi th the  candidat e. The und erl yin g assumption behind this methodol
og y is that tem peratur es ov
er a region have similar tendencie
s in variation.  If this 
assumption is violated, the potenti al disc
ontinuity is evaluated for sta tistical signi
fi canc e.  Where significant discontinuiti
es are detected, the difference in 
average annu al temperatu res bef ore and aft er the inhomogeneit y is  
applied to adjust the mean of th e earlier block wi th  the mean
 of th e latter block of 
data. Such an ev aluation requires a minimum of five yea rs bet
ween discontinuities .Consequentl y, 
if m ultiple changes occur wi th
in five years or if a 
change occurs ver y n ear the  end of the norm als period (
e.g.,
 after 1995), the discontinuity m a y n ot b e
 detectable using this methodolog y.  
The monthl y nor mals for maximu m and minimum temperatu re and precip
itation are computed simply b y avera ging the  approp riate 30 v
alues from 
the 1971- 2000 r e cord. The mo nthly averag e tempe rature n ormals ar
e computed b y a v eraging the corr esponding month l y m aximum an d m
inimum 
normals. The an nual temperatu re  normals are calculated b y taki
ng t he average of t h e 12 monthl y nor mals. The annual  precipitatio
n and degree d a y 
normals are the sum of the 12 m onthl y no rmals.   Trace pr ecipit
ation totals are sho wn as zero.  Precipitation totals include ra
in and t he liquid equivalent 
of frozen and f re ezing precipitation (
e.g
., sno w, sle et, freezing rain, and hail).  Fo r m an y NWS loca
tio ns, indicated wi th  an ‚*™ next to ‚H DD™ and ‚CDD™ in  
the degre e da y t able, degree da y normals are co mputed directl y f r om
 daily values for the 197 1-200 0  period.  Fo r all other stati
ons, estimated degr ee da y 
totals are based on a modification of the 
rational co nversion formula developed b y Th om
 (1966 ), using daily spline-fit m eans an
d standa rd deviations of 
average tempe ra ture as inputs.
