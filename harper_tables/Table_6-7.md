Estimates of annual mass loadings of 
nitrogen and phosphorus discharging from 
undeveloped/natural areas were generated for each
 of the hydrologic soil groups and meteorological 
zones included in Tables 6-6 and 6-7.  The annua
l runoff volume generated by each combination of 
meteorological zone and hydrologic soil group was cal
culated, assuming a theoretical area of 1 acre, 
using the annual runoff coefficients summarize
d in Table 6-6 and the annual rainfall depth 
represented by each meteorological site.  The estimated annual runoff volumes were then multiplied 

by the assumed runoff characteristics for undevelope
d/natural areas summarized in Table 4-17.  For 
purposes of this analysis, total nitrogen concentr
ations in runoff discharging from undeveloped/ 
natural areas is assumed to be 1.15 mg/l, with a total phosphorus concentration of 0.055 mg/l. 
 

Estimates of the annual mass loadings of n
itrogen and phosphorus generated by stormwater 
runoff in undeveloped/natural areas are summarized 
in Table 6-8.  Annual mass loads are calculated 
for each hydrologic soil group and meteorological z
one in terms of kg/acre-year for both total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus.  The values summarized in this table represent the pre-development  

loadings  generated  by  undeveloped/na
tural areas for each hydrologic soil group and 
meteorological zone.  To achieve the goal of no 
net increase in loadings following development, 
discharges of total nitrogen and total phosphorus 
from the land parcel following development cannot 
exceed the pre-development values listed in Table 6-8.
