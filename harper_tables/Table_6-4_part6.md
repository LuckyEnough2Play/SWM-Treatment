6.3 Design Criteria to Achieve Post-Development
 
Less Than or Equal to Pre-Development Loadings
 
 
An analysis was also performed to provide estimates of the annual mass pollutant removal 
efficiencies necessary to achieve no net increa
se in pollutant loadings following development 
compared with loadings which discharge from the site under pre-development conditions.  This 

analysis is conducted primarily for nitrogen a
nd phosphorus, since systems which achieve post <
 pre 
pollutant loadings for nitrogen and phosphorus will 
automatically provide this condition for TSS, 
BOD, and other significant runoff pollutants. 

 

 
6.3.1 Estimation of Pre-Development Pollutant Loadings
 
 
This analysis assumes that the undeveloped 
condition consists of brush (brush-weed-grass 
mixture), woods, or a mixture of the two.  A 
summary of hydrologic assumptions for this pre-
development condition is given in Table 6-5. 
 For estimation of annual runoff volumes, the 
hydrologic  condition  is assumed to be fair, w
ith 50-75% ground cover and litter covering much of 
the soil.  SCS curve numbers for use in hydrol
ogic modeling are assumed for hydrologic soil groups 
(HSG) A, B, C, and D using the average curve num
bers for brush and wooded areas provided in the 
TR-55 publication.

Calculated annual C values for undeveloped/na
tural areas are summarized in Table 6-6 for 
each of the regional meteorological zones.  Th
ese values are calculated using the continuous 
simulation technique discussed in Section 4.2 and 
the hydrologic characteristics listed in Table 6-5. 
The mean values summarized at the bottom of Table 6-6 reflect the state-wide mean rather than the 

arithmetic mean of the values for each zone. In 
general, approximately 1.5% or less of the annual 
rainfall which occurs on undeveloped/natural ar
eas under HSG A conditions becomes stormwater 
runoff.  Under HSG B conditions, this percentage
 increases to approximately 4-7%, with 9-13% 
under HSG C conditions and 13-18% under HSG D conditions.
