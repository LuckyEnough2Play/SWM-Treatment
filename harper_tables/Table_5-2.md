In many of the studies, the ability of the sy
stem to remove total nitrogen was heavily 
dependent upon the proportion of total nitrogen pres
ent as organic nitrogen.  Organic nitrogen is 
not readily available, either biologically or ch
emically, and there are relatively few mechanisms 
for removal of this species in a wet 
detention system.  In contrast, both NO
x
 and NH
3
 are readily 
taken up in biological processes which accounts 
for the relatively good removal efficiencies 
achieved for these species in wet detention ponds. 
 In systems where organic nitrogen represents 
the dominant portion of the total nitrogen in the incoming stormwater flow, removal of total 

nitrogen can be expected to be relativ
ely poor.  If inorganic species of NO
x
 and NH
3
 represent 
the dominant nitrogen species found, then removal efficiencies for total nitrogen can be expected 

to increase.  On an average basis, wet detenti
on systems with a detention time of 14 days can be 
expected to provide a net removal of approxima
tely 20-40% for total nitrogen; 60-70% for total 
phosphorus and copper; and 75-85% or more for TSS, total lead and total zinc. 
 

The report by Harper and Herr (1993) presents
 separate removal efficiencies for pond 
residence times of approximately 7 days, along with
 detention times of 14 days or more.  With 
the exception of TSS, increasing the pond detenti
on time results in a slight improvement in 
removal efficiencies for the listed parameters.  
At a detention time of 7 days, removal of total 
nitrogen, total phosphorus and TSS is estimated
 to be approximately 20%, 50%, and 85%, 
respectively.   At a detention time of 14 days
, removal of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and 
TSS increase slightly to approximately 30%, 70%, and 85%, respectively. Little additional 

improvement in removal efficiencies was observe
d for most parameters at detention times in 
excess of 14 days up to the maximum detention time of 41 days included in the study. 
 

The report by Ruston, et al. (1995) summarizes 
pollutant removal efficiencies achieved 
within a wet detention pond in Tampa which recei
ves stormwater runoff from a light commercial 
area.  Pollutant removal efficiencies are provi
ded for pond detention times of 2, 5, and 14 days.  
In general, pollutant removal efficiencies obtaine
d at a detention time of 2 days are lower than 
removal efficiencies obtained at a detention tim
e of 14 days for all evaluated parameters.  
However,  the lowest removal efficiencies in th
e study were obtained at the 5-day detention time. 
Rushton, et al. reports that the lower efficien
cies observed during the 5-day detention time study 
period were highly influenced by one extreme st
orm event where almost 6 inches of rain 
occurred during a single week. 

 

 The most recent study to evaluate impacts 
of residence time on performance efficiency 
was conducted by DB Environmental (2005).  Th
is study was performed on a wet detention pond 
in Melbourne where portions of the pond were is
olated to create microcosms to simulate 
residence times of 1, 7, and 14 days.  In general, removal efficiencies for all of the evaluated 

parameters increased with increases in deten
tion time within the microcosms.  The removal 
efficiencies achieved at the 14-day residence tim
e are similar to values reported by Harper and 
Herr (1993), also for a 14-day residence time.

5.1.3 Dry Detention (With and
 
Without Filtration/Underdrains)
 
 
Historically, dry detention facilities have 
been one of the most common stormwater 
management techniques used throughout the State of
 Florida, particularly in South Florida. 
These systems are typically utilized in hi
gh groundwater table areas where the normal 
groundwater level makes the use of a retention type
 facility less feasible.  Dry detention systems 
are intended to be dry basins which are designed 
to hold a specific quantity
 of stormwater runoff 
(treatment volume).  Recovery of the design  treatme
nt  volume  occurs  as  a result of migration 
of the stormwater runoff through the pond bottom, 
discharge through an outfall orifice structure, 
or into an underdrain system or
 side bank filter constructed around the perimeter or bottom of the 
pond. 
 

A  schematic  diagram of a dry detention sy
stem (with underdrain) is provided in Figure 
5-3.  The underdrain system is typically used to
 control the existing groundwater table elevation 
in the vicinity of the pond and to improve the r
ecovery rate of the pollution abatement volume. 
Dry detention ponds are also constructed with side bank filters which perform a similar function.

Dry detention systems (without filtration) ha
ve been used commonly within the South 
Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) 
and the Southwest Florida Water Management 
District (SWFWMD).  In the St. Johns Rive
r Water Management District (SJRWMD), dry 
detention is limited to projects less than 5 acres
 in size or where the ground water table or soil 
conditions limit the feasibility of other BMPs.  
Dry detention systems utilize an orifice or V-
notch to slowly discharge the specified treatment volume following a storm event.   
 

Physical processes such as sedimentation, a
nd chemical processes such as precipitation 
and adsorption, are the primary mechanisms respons
ible for pollutant removal in dry detention 
with underdrain systems.  Stormwater inputs into
 these systems are typically evacuated within 
24-72 hours, and as a result, biological processes 
such as uptake of nutrients by plant surfaces 
and roots, are severely limited and do not play a 
significant role in the removal of stormwater 
pollutants.  Removal of particulate pollutant
s by sedimentation within the pond, as well as 
entrapment of particles within 
the filter system or soils during migration toward the underdrain 
system, are the primary physical removal processe
s in dry detention with filtration systems. 
Removal of particulate forms of phosphorus 
and heavy metals may also occur due to 
sedimentation through the pond. These systems have an extremely limited ability to remove 

dissolved constituents, most of which are best removed through biological processes. 
 

Many dry detention systems which utilize underdrains are constructed in a manner which 
requires the stormwater to migrate through on-site
 soil prior to entering the underdrain system. 
This design technique probably enhances the rem
oval efficiencies achieved by these systems due 
to the natural adsorption capacity of soils.  
Other designs pass the runoff through sand filer 
media prior to discharge.  However, the ability of common silica sand filter systems to remove 

dissolved constituents is severely limited (Harper and Herr, 1993).   
 

As seen in Figure 5-3, the underdrain and f
ilter systems associated with dry detention 
facilities are sometimes constructed to intercept 
and control the existing groundwater elevations 
in the vicinity of the basin to maintain a dr
y pond bottom.  This causes an influx of on-site 
groundwater into the underdrain system, resulting in a continuous flow from the system which is 

unrelated to rain events.  This continuous fl
ow of groundwater may actually create a system 
where substantially more mass leaves the stormwat
er facility on an annual basis than enters the 
system through stormwater runoff. 
 

However, it is possible for dry detention syst
ems to provide good removal efficiencies for 
total nitrogen, total phosphorus, TSS, and BOD.  
This can be accomplished by ensuring that the 
seasonal high groundwater table is one or mo
re feet below the proposed pond bottom and 
underdrain elevation.  The separation between
 pond bottom and seasonal high groundwater table 
elevation allows the pond to function as a dry re
tention pond system for some rain events.  One-
hundred percent removal is achieved for all r
unoff infiltrated through the pond bottom which is 
not intercepted by the underdrain system.  Pollu
tant removal efficiencies for dry detention 
systems can also be improved by removing the underdrain filter system, and replacing the filter 

system with a drawdown V-notch or orifice similar to a wet detention system.

As previously discussed, the pollutant remova
l effectiveness of dry detention systems are 
largely affected by the elevation of the underd
rain system and pond bottom in relation to the 
seasonal high groundwater table.  This is evident in
 the literature-based treatment efficiencies for 
the dry detention systems, provide
d in Table 5-3, based on selected research studies performed in 
Florida.   Each of these systems is constructed 
with a side bank filter sy
stem for drawdown of the 
treatment volume. The first entry in Table 5-3 
contains removal efficiencies from research 
conducted at the Publix shopping center dry 
detention pond in Bradfordville, north of 
Tallahassee. Overall mass removal efficiencies greater than 80% were achieved for total 

nitrogen, total phosphorus, TSS, and BOD.  These 
high mass removal efficiencies were observed 
since 66% of the runoff entering the pond infiltrat
ed through the pond bottom.  Only 34% of the 
runoff which entered the pond discharged through the underdrain system or the overflow 

structure.  This pond functioned much differently
 than typical dry detention with filtration 
systems in other areas of Florida.
