TOTAL  ANTECEDENT  5-DAY  RAINFALL  (inches) 
DORMANT  SEASON

III > 1.1 > 2.1 
 
 

 

 The tabular curve number values presente
d in textbooks and handbooks generally reflect 
antecedent moisture Condition II.  These values can be
 modified to reflect either antecedent moisture 
Condition I or III, based upon the antecedent cumu
lative 5-day rainfall using the relationships 
summarized in Table 4-21 (McCuen, 1982).  Mathemati
cal expressions for these relationships have 
been developed by Chow, et al. (1988) as follows: 

 

 

 
CN (I) =
4.2 CN (II) 
10 Å’ 0.058 CN (II) 
 
 

and 

 

 
CN (III) =
23 CN (II) 
10 + 0.13 CN (II)
