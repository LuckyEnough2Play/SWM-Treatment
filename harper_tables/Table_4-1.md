 than 1 acre or less than one 
dwelling unit per acre; internal 
roadways associated with 
the homes are also included 
Single-Family 
Reside ntial 
Typical detached home community with lot si

internal roadways associated w
ith the homes are also included 
Low-Intensity

office sites, and small shopping centers; internal roadways associated with the development 

are also included 
High-Intensity 
Commercial 
Land use consisting of commercial areas with 
high levels of traffic volume and constant 
traffic moving in and out of the area; includes downtown areas, commercial sites, regional 

malls, and associated parking lots; internal ro
adways associated with
 the development are 
also included 
Industrial Land uses include manufacturing, shippi
ng and transportation services, sewage treatment 
facilities, water supply plants, and solid waste dis
posal; internal roadways

loading rates for these categories 
Agriculture Includes cattle, grazing, row crops, citrus, and related activities 
Open/ 
Undeveloped 
Includes open space, barren la
nd, undeveloped land which ma
y be occupied by native

heavily fertilized and managed; 
golf course areas have runoff ch
aracteristics most similar to 
single-family residential areas 
Mining/

Includes a wide variety of mining activities fo
r resources such as phosphate, sand, gravel, 
clay, shell, etc. 
Wetlands Include a wide range of diverse wetland ty
pes, such as hardwood wetlands, cypress stands, 
grassed wetlands, freshwater marsh,
 and mixed wetland associations 
Open Water/ 
Lakes 
Land use consists of open water and lakes, ri
vers, reservoirs, and 
other open waterbodies

 Runoff characterization data for zinc, lea
d, and copper are most commonly available for 
commercial, residential, and highway land uses.  Ho
wever, even in these categories, the availability 
of the data is only considered to be fair to
 good.  Information on other heavy metals, such as 
cadmium, chromium, and nickel, as well as dissolved 
metal species, is poor in virtually all land use 
categories.  The only studies which include these 
latter parameters appear to be research-related 
projects. 

 

 Runoff characterization data for biochemi
cal oxygen demand (BOD) is fair to good in 
commercial, residential, and highway land use cate
gories.  A limited amount of information for this 
parameter is also present in agricultural studi
es.  However, chemical oxygen demand (COD) is 
measured relatively infrequently, and the data ava
ilability for this parameter is considered poor to 
fair. 

 

 Oils, greases, and hydrocarbons are measured
 on an infrequent basis in stormwater 
characterization studies.  Most of the studies incl
uding these parameters are research projects, many 
of which are designed specifically to address th
ese compounds.  Oils, greases, and hydrocarbons are 
generally evaluated through the generic oil and 
grease or TRPH (total recoverable petroleum 
hydrocarbon) lab tests.  Testing for specific compounds is extremely rare within the literature.

 Information on pathogens, such as total and fecal
 coliform, is poor in the available literature, 
with the majority of information addressing co
mmercial, residential, and highway land uses. 
Information on more specific pathogens, such as E. 
coli, is extremely poor for virtually all land use 
categories. 

 

 A literature review was conducted by Ha
rper during 1992-93 to identify significant 
stormwater characterization studies performed with
in the State of Florida. Bas ic information for 
many of the evaluated land uses was obtaine
d from the document by Harper (1994) titled 
ﬁStormwater Loading Rate Parameters for Central 
and South Floridaﬂ.  This report presents the 
results of an extensive literature search and 
analysis of runoff characteristics for selected 
parameters and land use types within Central 
and South Florida.  The runoff characteristics 
provided in this document include publications and studies conducted specifically within the 

State of Florida by a variety of state, fede
ral, and local governments, along with private 
consultants. 

 
Each study was reviewed for adequacy of the 
database, with special attention to factors 
such as length of study, number of runoff events monitored, monitoring methodology, as well as 

completeness and accuracy of the work.  In general, it is preferred that selected studies present at 

least a one-year period of data collection represen
ting a wide range of rainfall and antecedent dry 
period conditions.  Unfortunately, in a number of cas
es, the only available data base for a given land 
use category or loading parameter represented a relatively small and limited data collection process. 

These studies were carefully examined on a case-by-case basis and a decision was made as to 

whether or not to include the data in loading rate
 estimates.  No studies with less than five storm 
sample events were used.  An important requirement
 for inclusion of stormwater monitoring data is 
that the study measures only a homogeneous watershe
d area.  This requirement is necessary since 
input into most loading rate models is based upon homogeneous land use types.  Unfortunately, this 

requirement limited the usefulness of several 
thorough stormwater studi
es by the USGS which 
evaluated mixed land use areas.   

 

 Approximately 120 reports and publications of
 stormwater research conducted within the 
State of Florida were initially reviewed as a part 
of the literature search process.  During the initial 
review process, studies which contain an insuffi
cient number of sample events or address mixed 
land use areas were removed from further consid
eration, leaving approximately 40 reports with 
potential  pollutant loading information. 

 

 The Harper (1994) report includes all signi
ficant stormwater characterization studies 
performed in Florida prior to the early 1990s. 
 However, a limited number of additional runoff 
characterization studies have been performed 
since the publication date for this report.  
Therefore, a supplemental literature search 
was performed by ERD to identify additional 
resources for characterization data.  Additional land use characterization studies were obtained 

for single-family  residential  areas,  low-inte
nsity  commercial, highway/transportation land use, 
agriculture-citrus, agriculture-row crop, and ope
n space/undeveloped/rangeland/forest areas. 
The supplemental characterization data were comb
ined with the data provided by Harper (1994) 
to generate a database reflecting all significant ch
aracterization studies performed in Florida.  A 
brief summary of information contained within
 selected characterization studies from the 
combined database is given in Table 4-3. A lis
ting of hydrologic and general characteristics for 
studies included in the combined database is given in Appendix B.
