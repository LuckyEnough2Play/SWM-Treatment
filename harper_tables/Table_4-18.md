 The SCS method calculates the runoff volum
e for a given rainfall event by adding the 
rainfall excess (runoff) from the non-DCIA portion 
to the rainfall excess created from the DCIA 
portion of the land use.  Rainfall excess from
 the non-DCIA areas is calculated using the 
following set of equations:

 For the DCIA portion, rainfall excess is calculated using the following equation: 

 
Whe n P
i
 is less than 0.1, Q 
DCIAi
 is equal to zero.  This factor refl ects the initial abstraction for the 
impervious areas which assumes that the first 0.1 inch
 of rainfall is stored w
ithin the irregularities in 
the impervious surfaces and does not become stormwat
er runoff.  After these surfaces become filled 
with the initial 0.1 inch of rainfall, additional rain
fall begins to generate runoff on these surfaces. 
 

 One of the primary objectives of the hydrol
ogic modeling efforts conducted by ERD is to 
evaluate the impact of the variability in probability
 distributions of individual rain events throughout 
the State of Florida, as discussed in Section 
3.2, on rainfall/runoff relationships, as characterized by 
variabilities in modeled runoff coefficients.  The imp
acts of variability in the 
sizes of individual rain 
events can best be evaluated using a conti
nuous simulation hydrologic model which evaluates 
rainfall/runoff relationships over an extended period 
of time.  However, this type of continuous 
modeling cannot be adequately conducted using ra
infall data summarized on a daily basis.  A 
portion of the 111 NCDC meteorological stations 
within the State of Florida also provide 
precipitation records which are summarized on an hourly basis.  A listing of NCDC hourly 

precipitation monitoring stations in Florida is gi
ven in Table 4-19.  Hourly precipitation data is 
available from 45 separate monitoring stations, w
ith a period of hourly rainfall data ranging from 13-
64 years. 

 

 All available hourly precipitation data was obt
ained for each of the 45 monitoring stations 
listed in Table 4-19.  For each site, a conti
nuous simulation was conducted of rainfall/runoff 
relationships using the entire record
 of hourly precipitation data for each site based on the SCS curve 
number method.  This modeling included a mean of
 approximately 4685 individual rain events for 
each of the 45 monitoring stations.  A location map for the 45 hourly precipitation monitoring sites is 

given on Figure 4-1. 

 

 The pervious area curve number values listed 
in engineering texts and reference manuals, 
used to estimate the amount of runoff lost due to inf
iltration into the soil during a  rain event, reflect 
a ﬁnormalﬂ antecedent moisture condition at the time 
of the rain event.  These curve number values 
are commonly used for modeling design storm events
 (25- or 100-year storms) for developed areas 
where soil infiltration is a relatively insignifi can
t loss in comparison with the overall volume of 
runoff generated during these design storm even
ts.  However, when performing continuous 
simulation modeling, the soil moisture condition at th
e time of the rain event can have a significant 
impact on the runoff volume generated from pervi
ous areas.  The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) 
has developed three antecedent soil moisture c
onditions to account for variability in runoff 
generation as a function of antecedent rainfall c
onditions.  These three antecedent soil moisture 
conditions are labeled I, II, and III and are identified as follows:

light rainfall and low temperatures

   5 days; soils are saturated
