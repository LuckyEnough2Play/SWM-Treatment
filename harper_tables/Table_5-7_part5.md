 A comparison of annual mass removal efficien
cies for dry retention systems designed for 
treatment of 0.5 inch of runoff 
or the runoff from 1 inch of rainfall, based upon a hypothetical 
development with 40% DCIA and a non-DCIA curve 
number of 70, is given in Figure 5-8.  For each 
of the five meteorological zones, dry retention 
treatment for 0.5 inch of runoff provides a higher 
level of annual mass removal than criteria designed to
 treat the runoff from 1 inch of rainfall on the 
developed site.

5.2.2 WetDetention
 
 
 Wet detention stormwater treatment system
s are referenced by the St. Johns River, 
Suwannee River, Southwest Florida, and South Fl
orida Water Management Districts.  However, 
detailed design criteria which references residence time and pond depth are provided by only the St. 

Johns River and South Florida Water Management Di
stricts.   The design criteria established by the 
St. Johns River Water Management District provi
des for wet detention ponds with relatively short 
residence times, typically ranging from 14-21 days
, during wet season conditions.  Ponds designed 
in the St. Johns River Water Management District
 are also relatively shallow, with a maximum 
depth of 12 ft.  The South Florida Water Management
 District does not reference a specific criterion 
for residence time.  However, the District reco
mmends that 25-50% of the pond area be greater than 
12 ft in depth which tends to create ponds with 
substantially longer residence times than those 
designed within the St. Johns River Water Management District. 

 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

 Each of the four water management district
s mentioned previously provides calculations for 
a treatment volume associated with the wet dete
ntion system.  This treatment volume is often 
referred to as the ﬁwater quality volumeﬂ since the 
criteria are similar to the water quality treatment 
criteria for dry retention or dry detention.  Ho
wever, research on wet detention ponds clearly 
indicates that the most significant factor impacti
ng the performance efficiency of a wet detention 
pond is the residence time within the system - sp
ecifically, the volume of the permanent pool with 
respect  to  the  volume  of  runoff  entering  the  pond  (Toet, et al., 
1990;   Harper and Herr, 1993; 
Rushton, et al., 1995; and DB Environmental, 2005).  Since the specified treatment volumes are 

negligible in comparison to the permanent pool 
volume contained within the wet detention pond, the 
treatment volume criteria primarily regulates the drawdown characteristics of the wet detention pond 

and has little impact on the overall water quality performance efficiency of the system. 

 
Residence time within a wet detention pond is
 determined by the relationship between 
the permanent pool volume and the annual runoff inputs, as follows: 
 

 
 
where: 

 

 PPV = permanent pool volume (ac-ft) 

 

 RO = annual runoff inputs (ac-ft/yr) 
 
 

For purposes of this calculation, the permanent pool
 volume is considered to include the total 
volume of water within the pond below the control elevation.  

 

 Criteria related to residence time and pond dept
h are not included in specific design criteria 
outlined by the Suwannee River or Southwest Florida Water Management Districts.  Wet detention 

ponds designed in these districts could conceivabl
y have a wide range of detention times and 
associated performance efficiencies, with some 
ponds approaching design criteria similar to that 
used in the St. Johns River Water Management Di
strict and other ponds approaching design criteria 
utilized in the South Florida Water Management District.  As a result, estimates of the anticipated 

performance efficiency of wet detention systems 
designed in the St. Johns River and South Florida 
Water Management Districts will be presented in this
 section, with the anticipated efficiency of wet 
detention systems designed in the Suwannee River and Southwest Florida Water Management 

Districts likely to fall somewhere in between.

 5.2.2.1  SJRWMD Design Criteria
 
 
 Wet detention ponds designed according to St
. Johns River Water Management District 
(SJRWMD) criteria are characterized by relatively short residence times, ranging from 

approximately 14-21 days under wet season conditions
.  Virtually all existing research studies on 
wet detention systems, as summarized in Table 
5-2, have been performed on shallow ponds with 
relatively short residence times.  Six of the eight 
studies summarized in Table 5-2 are located in the 
St. Johns River Water Management District, although 
designs for some of the earlier studies may be 
different from current design criteria.   

 

 A summa ry of estimated performa nce effi
ciencies of wet detention ponds designed 
according to SJRWMD criteria is given in Table 5-8. 
 The values summarized in this table reflect the 
overall mean treatment efficiencies for wet deten
tion systems summarized in Table 5-2.  The values 
summarized in Table 5-8 correspond closely to perf
ormance efficiencies measured by Harper and 
Herr (1993) for a wet detention pond constructed 
according to SJRWMD criteria.  Based upon the 
estimated performance efficiency summarized in Ta
ble 5-8, with the possibl
e exception of TSS, wet 
detention ponds designed according to SJRWMD criteria fail to meet the 80% removal criteria 

outlined in Chapter 62-40.

5.2.2.2  SFWMD Design Criteria
 
 
 As discussed in a previous section, wet dete
ntion systems designed within the South Florida 
Water Management District (SFWMD) are often excav
ated to water depths of 20 ft or more.  The 
SFWMD does not have any specific limitation on pond 
depth, and developers often dig deep wet 
detention ponds to provide additional fill for low ar
eas within a development.  This technique can 
result in ponds with substantially extended detention times, often in excess of 200 days. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

 Although more research has been performed on 
wet detention systems than other stormwater 
management systems used within the State of Florid
a, relatively few of these studies have evaluated 
the relationship between detention time and performan
ce efficiency of the system.  Only three of the 
studies summarized in Table 5-2 provide measurem
ents of performance efficiency at designated 
detention times within the pond.  The remaining studi
es lack either basic bathymetric information on 
the pond or estimates of annual r
unoff inputs, both of which are necessary to estimate pond detention 
time.  Studies summarized in Table 5-2 which provide information on pond detention time are 

generally limited to a maximum residence time of 
14 days.  Virtually no si
gnificant research has 
been conducted specifically on wet detention ponds 
with extended residence times in excess of 100-
200 days similar to those constructed in the South Florida Water Management District. 

 

 A number of urban lakes which serve as regiona
l wet detention facilities have been evaluated 
by ERD as part of water quality improvement or
 stormwater management projects.  Detailed 
hydrologic and nutrient budgets were performed on 
each of these waterbodies which typically 
included direct measurements of hydrologic inputs, 
characterization of stormwater inputs, evaluation 
of inputs from groundwater seepag
e and bulk precipitation, and evaluation of the fate of nitrogen 
and phosphorus inputs into these systems.  Each of
 these studies included an estimate of the mean 
annual residence time within the waterbody, along w
ith an estimate of annual mass removal for both 
nitrogen and phosphorus.  Estimated detention times for the waterbodies evaluated in these studies 

range from 49-769 days.  Since the evaluated wa
terbodies function as regional wet detention 
facilities, these studies provide useful information 
on the anticipated performance efficiency of wet 
ponds under extended detention time conditions. 
 
 A summary of studies relating mass removal 
of nitrogen and phosphorus as a function of 
detention time in wet detention pond is given in Ta
ble 5-9.   The studies summarized in Table 5-2 
include research performed by Rushton, et al. 
(1995) and DB Environmental (2005), along with 
additional studies performed by ERD or Harper, 
et al. on regional wet detention facilities with 
extended residence times.  Nineteen studies are av
ailable which provide simultaneous estimates of 
detention time and phosphorus removal, with some of
 the studies providing data for more than one 
detention time.  Thirteen studies provide estimates
 of nitrogen removal as a function of detention 
time.   

 

 The information contained in Table 5-9 was en
tered into a statistical database, and a linear 
regression analysis was conducted to evaluate 
relationships between removal of nitrogen and 
phosphorus as a function of residence time within 
wet ponds.  Removal efficiencies for both total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus as a function of resi
dence time were observed to exhibit curvilinear 
relationships, with a relatively rapid initial rem
oval for both nutrients, followed by a slow gradual 
increase in removal efficiency over an extended pe
riod of time.  Various curvilinear models were 
evaluated to determine the model which provided 
the best-fit for the relationship between removal 
efficiency and residence time based upon the data set summarized in Table 5-9.
