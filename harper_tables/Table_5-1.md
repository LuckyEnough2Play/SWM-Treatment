It is obvious that removal efficiencies ach
ieved in retention systems are regulated 
primarily by the amount of runoff volume retaine
d.  In general, the annual pollutant removal 
effectiveness of a retention system should increas
e as the retention volume increases.  Since dry 
retention systems do not always recover the en
tire pollution abatement volume before the next 
storm event, the actual observed pollutant removal 
efficiencies for dry retention systems are less 
than the theoretical values presented by Wani
elista.  The removal efficiencies proposed by 
Wanielista incorporate a first-flush effect whic
h assumes that a large portion of the pollutant 
loading occurs in the initial por
tion of the runoff volume, increasing the theoretical removal 
efficiencies achieved by retention of a specified
 runoff depth.  However,
 in many watersheds, 
significant first-flush effects do not occur, and ther
efore, removal efficiencies will not be as high 
as reported in the Wanielista study.  Subsequent 
research has suggested that first-flush effects 
occur primarily on relatively small watersheds (< 
10 acres) with a high percentage of DCIA.  In 
large watersheds with a low or moderate DCIA 
percentage, significant first-flush effects may not 
occur. 
 

As development intensity increases, so doe
s the volume of runoff from a given storm 
event.  For example, a 1-inch storm event 
on a rural residential development may produce 0.2 
inches of runoff while the same storm event 
at a commercial site may produce 0.6 inches of 
runoff.  To achieve similar pollutant removal e
fficiencies, a larger retention treatment volume 
would be required for the commercial site than the 
rural residential site.  Therefore, the treatment 
volume alone cannot be directly correlated to the 
pollutant removal efficiency of the stormwater 
treatment system.  Instead, the achievable pollutant
 removal efficiencies are directly related to 
the development intensity and the specified treatme
nt volume.  This concept will be discussed in 
detail in Section 5.2.  With dry retention treatment systems, the mass pollutant removal 

efficiencies are directly related to the volume of
 runoff retained as a percent of the total runoff 
volume produced.

5.1.2 Wet Detention Systems
 
 
Wet detention systems are currently a very
 popular stormwater management technique 
throughout the State of Florida, particularly 
in areas with high groundw
ater tables.  A wet 
detention pond is simply a modified detention f
acility which is designed to include a permanent 
pool of water.  These permanently wet ponds ar
e designed to slowly release collected runoff 
through  an  outlet structure.  A schematic diagra
m of a wet detention system is given in Figure 
5-2.

Pollutant removal processes in wet dete
ntion systems occur through a variety of 
mechanisms, including physical processes such as
 sedimentation, chemical processes such as 
precipitation and adsorption, and biological uptake fr
om algae, bacteria, and rooted vegetation. 
In essence, these systems operate similar to a natural lake system.

The water level in a wet detention system is 
controlled by an orifice located in the outfall 
structure from the pond.  A treatme
nt volume above the orifice invert elevation is calculated for 
each facility based upon a specified depth of runo
ff over the contributing drainage basin area. 
Inputs of stormwater runoff equa
l to or less than the treatment volume leave the facility through 
an orifice in the outfall structure, percola
tion into the surrounding groundwater table, or by 
evaporation.  Stormwater inputs into the facility 
in excess of the treatment volume can exit from 
the facility directly over a weir included in the pond outfall structure.  The weir is designed to 

provide attenuation for peak storm events so that
 the post-development rate of discharge from 
the facility does not exceed the pre-development ra
te of discharge for a specified design storm, 
typically a 25-year storm event.  A littoral zone
 may be planted around the perimeter of a wet 
detention facility to provide additional biological uptake and enhanced biological communities.  
 

Upon entering a wet detention facility, stormwater inputs mix with existing water 
contained in the permanent pool.  Physical, chem
ical, and biological pro
cesses begin to rapidly 
remove pollutant inputs from the water column. 
 Water which leaves through the orifice in the 
outfall structure is a combination of the mixture 
of stormwater and the water contained within 
the permanent pool.  In general, the concentra
tion of constituents in the permanent pool are 
typically much less than input concentrations in stormwater runoff, resulting in discharges from 

the facility which are substantially lower in con
centration than found in raw stormwater.  As a 
result, good removal efficiencies are achieved 
within a wet detention facility for most 
stormwater constituents.  Although the littoral 
zone provides a small amount of enhanced 
biological uptake, previous research has indicated
 that a vast majority of removal processes 
occurring in wet detention facilities occur within 
the permanent pool volume rather than in the 
littoral zone vegetation for the treatment volume 
(Harper, 1985; Harper 1988; Harper and Herr, 
1993).   
 

Wet detention systems offer several advantag
es over some other stormwater management 
systems.  First, wet detention systems provide relatively good removal of stormwater 

constituents since physical, chemical, and biological
 mechanisms are all available for pollutant 
attenuation.  Other stormwater management fac
ilities provide only one or two of these basic 
removal methods for stormwater.  A second adva
ntage of wet detention systems is that the 
systems are not complex and can be relatively eas
ily maintained.  Wet detention systems do not 
have underdrain systems which can become cl
ogged and need periodic maintenance.  Wet 
detention systems can be viewed as amenities in development projects. 
 

Of the stormwater facilities investigated 
during this evaluation, probably the most 
amount of research within the State of Florida has been conducted on wet detention systems. 

Unfortunately, much of the existing research
 was conducted on wet detention systems which 
were not constructed to current design st
andards regarding mean detention time, pond 
configuration, and depth.  The majority of th
e available studies do not present information 
regarding the treatment volume or residence time 
within the wet detention system.  However, 
based on the relative pond area and volume for the various studies, it appears that the typical 

residence time provided in the evaluated ponds is approximately 15 days or less.

A summary of treatment efficiencies for 
wet detention systems based on selected 
research studies in Florida is given in Ta
ble 5-2.  Measured removal efficiencies for 
orthophosphorus, total phosphorus, TSS, and heavy me
tals are relatively consistent between the 
studies presented within the table.  In contrast
, a high degree of variability in measured removal 
efficiencies is present for total nitrogen.  Rem
oval efficiencies for total nitrogen range from 12-
63% for the studies presented in Table 5-2.  
Wet detention systems provide mean removal 
efficiencies of approximately 60-65% for to
tal phosphorus, BOD, and copper, while removal 
efficiencies for orthophosphorus, TSS, lea
d, and zinc approach or exceed 75-85%.
