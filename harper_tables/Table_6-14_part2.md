Differences between the required removal e
fficiencies for nitrogen and phosphorus to 
achieve no net increase in loading under post-deve
lopment conditions are due primarily to the 
differences   in   runoff   characteristics   for   ge
neral   land   use  categor
ies  between  nitrogen  and 
phosphorus.  As seen in Table 4-17, nitrogen concen
trations increase by a factor of approximately 
1.1-3 under developed conditions, compared with 
values measured under undeveloped conditions. 
However, total phosphorus concentrations increase by 
a factor of approximately 3-9, suggesting that 
removal efficiencies for total phosphorus need to be
 greater than those which occur for total nitrogen 
to reach pre-development loading conditions.  
 

A graphical comparison of required removal effi
ciencies to achieve no net increase in post-
development loadings is given in Figure 6-6 for 
low-density residential areas, Figure 6-7 for single-
family residential (25% impervious), Figure 6-8 for single-family residential (40% impervious), 

Figure 6-9 for high-density residential, Figure 
6-10 for commercial areas, Figure 6-11 for highway 
areas (50% impervious), and Figure 6-12 for highw
ay areas with 75% impervious.  A stormwater 
management system designed according to the goal of the Water Resource Implementation Rule 

(Chapter 62-40) of 80% removal will achieve a no ne
t increase in nitrogen loadings for low-density 
residential areas and single-family residential (
25% impervious) constructed in HSG B, C, and D 
soils, single-family residential (40% impervious),
 and highway areas (50% impervious) constructed 
in HSG D soils.  However, these same developments
 constructed in HSG A soils and other soil types 
not listed will fail to meet this criterion and will n
eed supplemental stormwater treatment to achieve 
the goal of no net increase in nitrogen loadings. 

 
A stormwater management system designed fo
r 80% removal will not achieve a condition of 
no net increase for total phosphorus for any of the ev
aluated land use categories.  In some  cases, 
removal  efficiencies  as  high 
 as  99% must be achieved to obtain the goal of no net increase in 
phosphorus loadings, particularly for development 
constructed in HSG A areas.  Even systems 
constructed to OFW design criteria, equivalent to a 95% annual mass removal, will fail to meet the 

objective of no net increase in total phosphorus load
ings for many combinations of land use category 
and hydrologic soil group. 

 

 

 
6.4  Evaluation of Wet Detention Pond Depth
 
 

6.4.1 Theory of Shallow vs. Deep Ponds
 
 
 One of the most controversial design para
me t e rs for st ormwa t e r mana ge me nt  syst e ms 
involves the constructed depth for wet detention 
ponds.  As discussed in Section 5.2.2, wet detention 
systems designed in the St. Johns River Water Mana
gement District are limited to a maximum of 12 
ft in depth, with a mean depth ranging from 2-8 ft
, and relatively short detention times ranging from 
14-21 days during wet season conditions.  In contrast
, the South Florida Water Management District 
recommends that 25-50% of the pond area be greater 
than 12 ft in depth which tends to create ponds 
with detention times on the order of several hundred days.

 Neither of the design criteria outlined in th
e previous paragraph is supported by specific 
research projects designed to address allowabl
e depths for wet detention ponds.  The depth 
limitation of 12 ft for wet detention ponds designe
d in the St. Johns River Water Management 
District appears to have been influenced by severa
l previous research projects designed to evaluate 
the effectiveness of a particular wet detention 
pond design.  These ponds, which were coincidentally 
designed to a maximum depth of approximately 
12 ft, maintained aerobic conditions throughout the 
water column of each pond, resulting in the conclu
sion that wet detention ponds constructed to a 
depth of 12 ft would maintain aerobic conditions. 

 

 In order to understand factors which may imp
act the allowable depths for wet detention 
ponds, it is essential to understand that wet dete
ntion ponds are simply man-made lake systems 
subject to the same physical, chemical, and biological
 processes which exist in natural lake systems. 
Virtually every lake in Florida, particularly 
in urbanized environments, acts as a regional wet 
detention facility for runoff inputs generated from
 the surrounding areas.  The limnological concepts 
of nutrient uptake, chemical and biological 
transformations, and primary productivity are no 
different in waterbodies which have been assigne
d permit numbers than in waterbodies which have 
been assigned formal names. 

 

 The underlying assumption in maximizing the 
pollutant removal effectiveness of a wet 
detention pond is that aerobic conditions must be 
maintained throughout the water column at all 
times.  Assuming that aerobic conditions are reflect
ed by dissolved oxygen concentrations in excess 
of 1 mg/l, this means that dissolved oxygen concentr
ations must be in excess of 1 mg/l within the 
water column at all times. 
 

The depth of anoxia in a waterbody, defined as
 the water depth at which dissolved oxygen 
concentrations drop below 1 mg/l, is highly corre
lated with the algal productivity which exists 
within the pond.  At low levels of algal productivity, 
light penetration can extend to deeper layers of 
the pond, which increases the portion of the water column in which photosynthetic activities take 

place and increases the depth of anoxia.  As algal 
productivity increases, light penetration into the 
water column is restricted, and the depth of anoxia 
begins to approach closer to the surface. This 
phenomenon is well documented by limnologists who consistently observe that eutrophic lakes with 

high levels of algal productivity often develop anoxi
c conditions at a relatively shallow water depth, 
while lake systems exhibiting oligotrophic charact
eristics and low algal productivity often maintain 
aerobic conditions to depths of 30-
40 ft.  The fact that a wet detention pond is constructed to a 
maximum depth of 12 ft in no way 
guarantees that aerobic conditions will be maintained within the 
pond at all times.  In fact, a wet detention pond w
ith a deeper depth and larger permanent pool 
volume, receiving the same mass loadings as a 12-
ft deep pond, would exhibit substantially lower 
algal productivity and have a correspondingly deeper 
depth for the anoxic zone.  As a result, the 
allowable depth of a wet detention pond should be ev
aluated with respect to the anticipated algal 
productivity within the pond rather than an arb
itrary depth which may or may not achieve the 
objective of maintaining aerobic conditions within the water column. 

 

 Maximizing the depth of a wet detention 
pond while still maintaining aerobic conditions 
provides several significant water quality benefits. 
 First, deeper ponds generally have a larger 
permanent pool volume which decreases the likelihood of water quality violations at the outfall from 

runoff  inputs  entering  the  pond.  When a pond 
has a detention time of several hundred days, 
runoff  inputs  into  the  system  reflect  a  very 
 small  percentage  of  the  available permanent pool 
volume.  This permanent pool volume provides signi
ficant attenuation and dilution for runoff inputs, 
minimizing variability in discharges from the pond 
and water quality violations.  On the other hand, 
runoff inputs into a pond with a relatively short 
detention time comprise a significantly larger 
portion of the permanent pool volume, increasing th
e likelihood of water quality violations at the 
outfall. 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
6-44 
 

 
 Another advantage of deeper ponds is the incr
eased storage for suspended solids provided in 
these systems.  As shallow detention ponds begin 
to fill in with sediments, aquatic vegetation 
(commonly cattails) begins to encroach into 
the pond, creating significant negative water quality 
impacts.  In deeper ponds, this phenomenon is substantially postponed.  Shallow ponds with a short 

residence time also tend to be highly productive and often have aesthetically unpleasing algal 

blooms.  Homeowners associations often contract 
with aquatic weed control companies to correct 
these visual concerns using herbicides or coppe
r-based algicides, both of which decrease the 
performance efficiency of the pond and increase th
e likelihood of water quality violations at the 
pond outfall. 

 

  
6.4.2 Zonation and Stratification
 
 
Typical zonation in a pond or lake is illust
rated on Figure 6-13.  The upper portions of 
the water column in a waterbody are typically well mixed, with a relatively uniform temperature. 

This upper layer, often called the epilimnion, is
 the area in which the majority of algal 
production within the lake occurs.  In this
 zone, photosynthesis exceeds respiration, and 
adequate levels of dissolved oxygen are typically 
maintained.  Lower layers of a lake are often 
isolated from the upper layers as a result of
 thermal stratification within the waterbody. 
Penetration of sunlight into these lower layers
 is typically poor, and as a result, little algal 
productivity occurs in these areas.  In this lo
wer zone, commonly referred to as the hypolimnion, 
respiration exceeds photosynthesis, and the wate
r column may become void of dissolved oxygen 
during portions of the year.   
 
 
Figure 6-13.  Typical Zonation in a Lake or Pond. 
 

 

 
 Development of stratification in waterbodies 
occurs primarily as a result of differential 
absorption  of  solar  energy  w
ithin  the  water  column resulting in relatively large temperature 
differences between the upper warm epilimnion wate
r and the lower cooler hypolimnion water.  In 
Florida, temperature differences as high as 8-10
C can occur during the summer months between 
the epilimnion and the hypolimnion in a deep water
body.  Temperature differences within the water 
column result in density gradients which inhibit 
circulation between surface and deeper portions of 
the water column, resulting in stable stratified conditions. 

 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
6-45 
 

 
 Under stratified conditions, the hypolimni
on becomes isolated from oxygen input 
mechanisms such as reaeration from the surface and algal production, and anaerobic conditions may 

develop in deeper waters.  Anaerobic or anoxic c
onditions are considered to occur when dissolved 
oxygen concentrations in portions of a waterbody decrease to less than 1 mg/l.  These conditions 

may increase the release of ions such as ammonia and orthophosphorus, along with gases such as 

H
2
S and CO
2
, from the bottom sediments into 
the hypolimnion water where significant 
accumulation of these ions and gases can occur.
  The accumulated constituents in the hypolimnion 
can then be circulated into the epilimnion as a re
sult of a destratifying event, such as a prolonged 
windy period or strong storm event, theoretically 
resulting in episodes of reduced water quality. 
Circulation may also occur naturally within a waterbody with seasonal changes in temperature. 
 
 Stratified conditions commonly develop as a re
sult of absorption of solar energy by particles 
in the water column, either as a result of turbid
ity or by excess algal production near the surface.  
Both inorganic particles and organic matter can
 strongly absorb solar radiation and create a 
significant degree of stratification and a sharp decrease in temperature in the water column at depths 

below 4-6 feet if large quantities of suspended matte
r are present in the water column.  However, if 
significant suspended matter is not present in the wa
ter column, waterbodies as deep as 20 feet or 
more may not experience stratification or anaerobic conditions at deeper water depths. 

 

 One method of evaluating the potential for st
ratification in a waterbody is to perform 
estimates of anticipated algal production and corresponding chlorophyll-a values within the 

proposed system.  If algal production is predicted to
 be low, generally characterized by chlorophyll-a 
concentrations less than 5 mg/m
3
, then the potential for stratificati
on in a waterbody is low, and if it 
develops, it will occur in relatively deep portions 
of the water column.  The stratification potential 
increases substantially as chlorophyll-a concentr
ations increase above these values. If total 
phosphorus concentrations in a waterbody are 
known or can be estimated, the corresponding 
chlorophyll-a concentration can be calculated.  
Dillon and Rigler (19974) proposed the following 
empirical relationship between chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus, based on data collected primarily 

from northern temperate lakes: 

 

 
 
log (Chyl-a)   =   1.449   log  TP   -   1.136                             (Eq. 2) 
 
 

where: 

 

 

 TP  = Mean total phosphorus concentration (
˛
g/l) 
 

 

 

 Once the anticipated algal production and chlor
ophyll-a values in the aquatic system have 
been determined, corresponding  Secchi  disk  depths
  can  be  estimated 
 based  upon  a second 
empirical  relationship presented by Dillon and Rigl
er (1974), also based on data collected primarily 
from northern temperate lakes, which results in an estimated Secchi disk depth in meters, based upon 

a chlorophyll-a input in units of mg/m
3
 according to the following equation: 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
6-46 
 
where: 
 

 SD  = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

 Chyl-a =Chlorophyll-aconcentration(mg/m
3
) 
 

 

 

The Secchi disk is a simple device used to estimate 
water clarity in a lake or pond.  It consists of a 
weighted circular plate, 20 cm in diameter, with 
the surface painted with alternating black and white 
quarters.  The depth to which this disk can be seen in the water column is defined as the Secchi disk 

depth.  The Secchi disk depth in 
a body of water is generally assumed to correspond to a water depth 
where the available light is approximately 10-15% of the incident light at the water surface. 

 

 Although the general relationships referenced previously between total phosphorus, 

chlorophyll-a, and Secchi disk were developed prim
arily from data generated on northern temperate 
lakes, these equations have been utilized extensiv
ely within the State of Florida to model water 
quality characteristics in lakes.  However, for 
purposes of evaluating wet detention pond design, a 
revised evaluation of these relationships was 
conducted based specifically on water quality data 
colleted within the State of Florida.  As a sour
ce of data, the STORET database was searched for 
existing surface water data which includes simultaneous measurements for total phosphorus, 

chlorophyll-a, and Secchi disk for waterbodies with
in the State of Florida.  This data search 
generated in excess of 65,000 measurements whic
h include the three evaluated parameters. 
Unfortunately, this dataset exceeds the input capabilities for most commonly used statistical 

programs.  As a  result, average values were 
calculated for each monitoring location over the period 
of record contained within the STORET database.  Th
ese mean values were used to form a separate 
database which contained approximately 2467 individual 
data points.  This dataset was then used to 
perform regression analyses to evaluate relati
onships between total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, and 
Secchi disk specifically for Florida conditions. 

 

 A regression analysis was conducted to evaluate
 the most significant functional forms for the 
relationships between chlorophyll-a and total phosphor
us.  This evaluation indicated that a log-log 
relationship, similar to that expressed as Eq. 2, provides the best-fit between these parameters.  This 

regression analysis was evaluated for outliers by ex
amination of the Student T residuals and Cook™s 
D values.  Approximately 327 data points were elimin
ated from the data set as outliers during this 
process.  The remaining data set contained 2140 data points.   

 

 The best-fit relationship between chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus is summarized below:  

 

 

 
  ln (chyl-a)  =  1.058  ln  (TP)  -  0.934               R
2
  =  0.815

SD   =   8.7

where: 

 

 chyl-a = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 
 TP = total phosphorus concentration (
g/l) 
 

 

The best-fit relationship obtained with Florida data 
is similar to that originally proposed by Dillon 
and Rigler (1974) with different co
efficients and intercepts.  The R
2
 value for this relationship is 
0.815 which indicates that the value of total 
phosphorus explains approximately 82% of the 
variability in measured chlorophyll-a concentrations
.  This relationship can be used to estimate 
chlorophyll-a concentrations in the a detention 
pond based upon estimated concentrations of total 
phosphorus. 

  

 Predictive relationships between Secchi disk 
depth and chlorophyll-a were also evaluated 
based upon the Florida lakes data set.  A regression 
analysis for this relationship was also conducted 
to identify the best-fit relationship between the two 
variables.  A plot of the relationship between 
Secchi disk depth and chlorophyll-a for Florida lake
s is given in Figure 6-14.  The best-fit equation 
for  this  relationship  is  a  hyperbolic  e
quation  which  is summari
zed on Figure 6-14.  The R
2
 
value  of  0.807  for this relationship indicates th
at chlorophyll-a explains approximately 81% of the 
variability in Secchi disk depth within a waterbody in
 Florida.  This relationship may be used to 
estimate the Secchi disk depth in a waterbody based on measured or calculated values of 

chlorophyll-a.

 Development of stratification and anoxic c
onditions in a non-colored waterbody, such as a 
wet detention pond, is directly related to th
e amount of algal production and the corresponding 
Secchi disk depth within the water column.  
Although algal production adds oxygen in areas where 
active photosynthesis occurs, algal cells also absorb
 solar radiation and limit the amount of sunlight 
and corresponding algal productivity at deeper depths within the water column.  Wet detention 

ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited systems.  
Since algal production is limited primarily by 
inputs of total phosphorus, phosphorus is also an im
portant variable in determining the depth of 
anoxia. 
 
 A linear regression was developed to predict th
e depth of anoxia in a waterbody as a function 
of ambient concentrations of ch
lorophyll-a, total phosphorus, and Secchi disk depth.   The depth of 
anoxia was obtained from field measured dissolved
 oxygen profiles collected in a waterbody at the 
time of sample collection for laboratory analyses. 
 A data set was develope
d containing 426 sets of 
measurements of Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, 
total phosphorus, and depth of anoxia, defined as 
dissolved oxygen concentrations less than 1 mg/l, for waterbodies in Central and South Florida.  The 

data were generated from field monitoring and 
laboratory analyses conducted by ERD over the past 
20 years.  The data set was evaluated for outliers
 by examination of the Student T residuals and 
Cook™s D values.  A total of 54 
data points was eliminated as outliers.  Both linear and log 
transformations were performed on the variables to
 obtain the ﬁbest-fitﬂ model which maximizes R
2
 
while minimizing the mean square error (MSE).  
This modeling exercise is designed to maximize 
the predictability of the model rather than to examine functional forms.  The resulting linear 

regression relationship for the variables indicates th
at the depth of anoxia is regulated primarily by 
Secchi disk depth according to the following relationship: 

 

 
   Anoxic Depth = 3.035  x  Secchi Disk Depth (m) Œ 0.004979 
(Eq. 5) 
 
 x  Total P (
g/l)  +  0.02164  x  chyl-a (mg/m

) 
     
 
 
R

  =  0.951 
 
where: 

 

 Anoxic Depth = depth of anoxia (m) 

 

 

 

The above equation is valid for:  0.25 m  <  anoxic depth  <  9.0 m 

      0.09 m  <  Secchi disk depth < 3.49 m 
      1

Regression statistics for the anoxic depth model are given in Table 6-16.
