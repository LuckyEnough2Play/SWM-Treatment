3.2  Rainfall Event Characteristics
 
 
 A probability distribution of individual rain ev
ents occurring during the period of record for 
each of the selected meteorological sites was de
veloped by evaluating common rain events occurring 
at each of the sites during an average year.  H
ourly meteorological data was obtained from the 
NCDC for each of the selected me
teorological sites.  The continuous hourly rainfall record for each 
site was scanned to determine the total rainfall dept
h for individual rain events which occurred at the 
monitoring site over the period of record.   

 

 For purposes of this analysis, a rain event is defined as a period of continuous rainfall.  The 

US EPA typically uses a 6-hour separation for defi
ning individual rain events.  Using this criterion, 
rain episodes separated by less than six hours of dr
y conditions are considered to be one continuous 
event, while rain events separated by six hours or mo
re of dry conditions are assumed to be separate 
events. The six-hour separation period is thought to 
be the minimum period of no rainfall required to 
restore the hydrologic characteristics of the site
 to pre-rain event conditions.  Although this 
definition may work well in the temperate climat
es present throughout much of the U.S., this 
definition fails to consider the small convective ev
ents which occur frequently within the State of 
Florida, particularly during the summer months. For rain events in the range of 0.25 inches or more, 

an inter-event separation period of approximately
 six hours seems adequate to restore hydrologic 
characteristics for a Florida watershed.  Howeve
r, for events less than 0.25 inches, hydrologic 
characteristics can be restored rapidly, often within
 several hours.  Therefore, for purposes of this 
evaluation, a variable inter-event dry period is utili
zed.  When the cumulative hourly rainfall is equal 
to 0.25 inches or more, an inter-event dry period of 
six hours is required to initiate the start of a new 
rain event.  Rainfall which occurs less than six hour
s from the termination of the previous rainfall is 
assumed to be part of the original rainfall event. 
 However, for rain events less than 0.25 inches, an 
inter-event dry period of three hours is used to indi
cate the start of a new independent runoff event. 
 

 The available data sets for each of the 11 mete
orological sites were scanned and divided into 
individual rain events based upon the criteria outlined 
previously.I n d iv id u al r ain f all ev en ts at each  
of the 11 monitoring sites were divided into
 19 rainfall event ranges which include 0.00-0.10 
inches,  0.11-0.20  inches,  0.21-0.30  inches
,  0.31-0.40 inches, 0.41-0.50 inches, 0.51-1.00 inch, 
1.01-1.50 inches, 1.51-2.00 inches, 2.01-2.50 inches, 2.51-3.00 inches, 3.01-3.50 inches, 3.51-

4.00 inches, 4.01-4.50 inches, 4.51-5.00 inches
, 5.01-6.00 inches, 6.01-7.00 inches, 7.01-8.00 
inches, 8.01-9.00 inches, and greater than 9 inches. For each rainfall event range, the mean depth 

of rain events within the interval was calcula
ted.  A probability distribution was performed on all 
rainfall events within each rainfa
ll event range to determine the average number of rain events, 
the mean rainfall duration, the mean anteceden
t dry period, the  annual  rainfall  depth  
contributed  by  each  interval,  the  cumu
lative  annual  event volume, and cumulative 
percentage of annual rainfall  for each rainfall event range.  Frequency distributions of rain 

events in each of the 11 meteorological sites are given in Appendix A.4.

A comparison of the percentage of annual rain
 events occurring within the selected event 
intervals at the regional sites is given in Table 3-
2.  In general, it appears that the Key West and 
Miami monitoring sites have a higher percentage
 of relatively small events, which generate 
relatively little measurable runoff, and a lower perc
entage of larger rain events, compared with 
the remaining monitoring sites.  For example, approximately 83.7% of the rain events occurring 

at the Key West monitoring site and 80.6% of the events occurring at the Miami monitoring sites 

are equal to 0.5 inch or less compared with a st
ate-wide average of 75.1%.  Conversely, the  Ft. 
Myers and Cross City monitoring sites appear to ha
ve a lower percentage of small rain events, 
with 72.6% of the events at the Ft. Myers site 
and 70.8% of the events at the Cross City site 
having rainfall depths equivalent to 0.5 inches 
or less.  The Pensacola, Tallahassee, and Ft.  
Myers monitoring sites appear to have a higher percen
tage of large rain  events,  with  5.3%  of 
the Pensacola and Tallahassee and 3.9% of the Ft. My
ers rain events equivalent to 2 inches or 
greater compared with a state-wide average of 3.6%
 for this interval.  A graphical comparison of 
the percentage of annual rainfall events less than 1 inch in depth at each of the designated 

regional sites is given in Figure 3-4.
