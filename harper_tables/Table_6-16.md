DESIGN  EXAMPLES
 
 

 

 
Several design examples were developed to 
illustrate the basic methodology which would 
be utilized by a design engineer
 to develop an appropriate stor
mwater management system to 
meet the proposed modifications to existing stormw
ater design criteria summarized in Section 6. 
Design examples are provided based upon stormwater
 criteria intended to meet both the 80% and 
95% pollutant reduction target go
als outlined in Chapter 62-40.  
These design examples are also 
intended to illustrate differences in required water quality treatment volumes for different 

meteorological zones within the St
ate of Florida based on differen
ces in total annual rainfall and 
the frequency distribution for individual rain ev
ents.  In addition, design examples are also 
provided to illustrate treatment requirements nece
ssary to achieve a condition of no net increase 
in pollutant loadings for a developed 
site under post-development conditions.

The required retention depth 
to achieve an annual removal efficiency of 80% in 
the Pensacola (Zone 1) area is determined from Table 6-1 (Zone 1) based on

The required dry retention depth is 
obtained by iterat

percentages of 10 and 20, and for non-DCIA
 CN values between 80 and 90.  The 
required dry retention depth = 1.
52 inches over the developed area.
 
 

 
B. Orlando Project (Zone 2)
 
 
If the project was located in Orlando (Centr
al Zone), the required dry retention depth 
would be slightly different due to differences
 in the distribution of rain events.  The 
required rete ntion de pth would be obtained
 from Table 6-1 (Zon
e 2) by iterating 
between DCIA percentages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values between 80 
and 90.  The required dry re
tention depth = 0.96 inches
 over the developed area.
 
 

 
C. Key West Project (Zone 3)
 
 
If the project was located in Key West (Zone 3), the required dry retention depth 

would be slightly different due to differences
 in the distribution of rain events.  The 
required rete ntion de pth would be obtained
 from Table 6-1 (Zon
e 3) by iterating 
between DCIA percentages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values between 80 
and 90.  The required dry re
tention depth = 1.66 inches
 over the developed area.
 
 

 

 
2. WetDetention
 
 

 Treatment Train Approach
 
 
Calculati on of desi gn cri t eria for a wet deten
tion pond is based on determining the detention 
time required to achieve the 
desired pollutant removal efficiency of 80%.  For practical 
purposes, this efficiency is 
assumed to apply to nitrogen
 and phosphoru
s since other 
pollutants such as BOD and TSS ar
e typically removed at a faster
 rate than nutrients.  As 
discussed i n Secti on 5.2.2, wet detenti on syst
ems are capable of prov
iding a nnual ma ss load 
reduction for phosphorus in 
excess of 80% at extended detention times (> 200 days). 
However, wet detention ponds ar
e not capable of providing 80%
 removal for total nitrogen 
since removal efficiency for total nitrogen in
 wet detention ponds appears to peak at 
appr oximately 40- 45%.  
 
Therefore, when wet detention is desired as
 a treatment option, pr
e-treatment must be 
provided to enhance the total 
system performance efficiency 
to a minimum of 80% for total 
nitrogen.  Since dry retention provides the 
best pre-treatment in
 a minimal space, dry 
retention ap pears to be the pre-treatment system
 of choice for this application.  Ther e are 
many combinations of dry rete
ntion and wet detention which can provi de the desired 80% 
removal. 
 
Assume that a wet detention 
pond is designed with a 
residence time of 200 days.

Although the wet detention po
nd approaches the 80% remova
l criteria for TP, the removal

e, the remaining efficiency is achieved using dry detention.

2A.    PENSACOLA  
(ZONE  1)  PROJECT
 
 
 

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the 
development characteristics: 

 

 

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18.75% of develope d area  

  

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 1), the required removal ef
ficiency of 65.0% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.75 and 1.00 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.75 inch, the treat
ment efficiency is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 63.4%
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 1.00 inch, the treat
ment efficiency is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 70.5%
. 
 
By iterating between 0.75 inch (63.4%) and 1.00 inch (70.5%), the dry retention depth required to 
achie ve  65.0% re mova
l is 0.81 inch.

Therefor e, the requir ed tr eat
ment train will consist of: 
 

a.
 
0.81 inch dr y retention, followed by 
b.
 
Wet detention pond with a 2
00-day mean residence time 
 
Based on the relationships given in Figures 5-9 an
d 5-10, the removal effici
encies for TN and TP 
increase very little at detention 
times in excess of 
200 days.  Although 
the pond size may be 
increased (if desired) for fill or 
other purposes, the required dry re
tention pre-treatment depth will 
not be significantly reduced.  Ho
wever,  if the pond residence ti
me is decreased below 200 days, 
then the dry retention pre-treatment
 depth will increas
e correspondingly. 
 
 

 

 
2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic
s of the wet detention 
pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 
 
a. Calculateannualru
noff inputs to pond
 
 
The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 1). 
 

 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81. 4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously. 
 

 Annual C Value = 0.304 

 

 The annual r ainfall for the Pensacol
a area = 65.5 inches
 (Appendix A.3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 65.5 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.304 = 149.34 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 65.0% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 65. 0% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 149.34 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.650) = 52.27 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 200-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  52.27 ac-ft/yr  x  1 year/365 days
  x  200 days 
 =   28.64 ac-ft 
 

  
Assuming a mean pond depth of 
8 ft, the r equired pond ar ea = 
 

  Pond Area = 28.64 ac-

b. Estimate maximum allowable pond depth
 
 
The maximum allowable pond depth is directly re
lated to the anticipated
 algal productivity 
within the pond.  Ass uming that wet dete
ntion ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited 
ecosystems, the productivity 
ca n be e stimate d based on the me an TP c once ntration. 
 
 
1. Estimaterunoff
 characteristics
 
 
For a single-family residentia
l land use, the event mean 
concentrati on (emc) for TP 
in runoff can be obtain
ed from Table 4-17: 
 

 TP = 0.327 mg /l (singl
e-family residential) 
 

 

 

 

 
2. Calculate TP loading to wet detention pond
 
 

After  the  dry retention pre-treatment, th
e annual runoff input 
to the pond = 52. 27 
ac-ft/yr 
 

 
  TP load to pond = 
 
 
 

 
3. Calculate TP concentration in pond
 
 
At the proposed 200- day residence time, 
the TP removal was pr
eviously estimated 
as 79.9% . 
 

  Annual mass of TP remaining = 

 

   21.08 kg TP/yr  x  (1
 Œ 0.799)  =  4.24 kg TP/yr 
 

 
The mass will be distributed 
within the pond permanent pool volume (28.64 ac-ft) 
and the pond outflow.  Assu
ming that inflow and outflo
w are approximately equal, 
the outflow will 
be 52.27 ac-ft .

The relationship between TP and chlorophy

by the following relationship: 
 

     ln (chyl -a)  =  1.058 l n
 (TP)  -  0.934   (Eq. 4) 
 
 
  where:  chyl-a =  chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m

    TP = total P concentration (

If the proposed pond de pth e xc eeds the e s
timated anoxic zone depth of 12.2 ft, 
aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 12.2 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the 
wat er col umn t o t he maxi mum pond dept
h.  The specific design of the required 
system should be selected by a qualified aeration specialist. 
 
As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
vol ume for collect
ed solids.   
 
If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept
h of anoxia to demo
nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia. 
 

 
 
 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 12
.2 ft x 2/3 = 8.13 ft 
 

 Pond surface area = pond
 volume/mean depth = 28.64

From Appendix D (Zone 2), the required removal ef

achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.25 and 0.50 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.50 inch, the treat

DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency

By iterating between 0.25 inch (49.0%) and 0.50 inch (65.7%), the dry retention depth required to

The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 2). 
 

 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.253 

 

 The annual rainfall fo

 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 50.0 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1

 6. Calculate depth of an
oxic conditions in pond
 
 
  Using the relationship expres
sed in Eq. 5, the depth of 
anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 

 
Depth of  DO < 1 = 3.035  x  Secchi  + 0.02
164 (chyl-a)  Œ  0.
004979  x  Total P 
 

 
  where: 

 

   Depth of DO < 1 = anoxic depth (m) 

 

   Secchi   = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

   chyl-a   = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

   Total P   = total phosphorus concentration (
g/l) 
 

 

 
Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035 
(1.15)  +  0.02164 (20.5)  
-  0.004979 (42)  =  3.73 m
  =  12.2 ft
 
 
 

 
If the pr oposed pond depth exceeds the estimated photic zone depth of 12.2 ft, 

aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 12.2 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the 
wat er col umn t o t he maxi mum pond dept
h.  The specific design of the required 
system should be selected by a qualified aeration specialist. 
 
As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
vol ume for collect
ed solids.   
 
If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept
h of anoxia to demo
nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia. 
 

 
 
 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 12
.2 ft x 2/3 = 8.13 ft 
 

 Pond surface area = pond
 volume/mean depth = 18.21 
ac-ft/8.13 ft = 2.24 ac

(ZO NE  3)  PROJECT
 
 
 

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the 
development characteristics: 

 

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18. 75% of develope d area  

  

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 3), the required removal ef
ficiency of 65.0% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.75 and 1.00 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.75 inch, the treat
ment efficiency is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project conditions is 65.0%
.  There is no need to conduc
t further iterations since a dry 
retention depth of 0.75 inch will provide 
the requir ed r emoval efficiency of 65.0%. 
 
The dry retention depth required to 
ac hieve 65.0% re moval is 0. 75 inc h.  
 
Therefor e, the requir ed tr eat

2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic
s of the wet detention 
pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 
 
A. Calculateannualru
noff inputs to pond
 
 
The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 3). 
 
 For: DCIA = 18.75%and non-DCIA CN = 81.4 

 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.266 

 

 The annual rainfall for the Key West
 area = 40.0 inches
 (Appendix A.3) 
 
 

 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 40.0 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.266 = 79.80 ac-ft/yr 
 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
7-14 
 

 
The calculated efficiency of 65.0% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 65.0% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 79.80 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.650) =  27.93 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 200-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  27.93 ac-ft/yr  x  1 year/365 days
  x  200 days 
 =   15.30 ac-ft 
 

 
 
 
B. Estimatemaximum 
all owable pond depth
 
 
The maximum allowable pond depth is directly re
lated to the anticipated
 algal productivity 
within the pond.  Ass uming that wet dete
ntion ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited 
ecosystems, the productivity 
ca n be e stimate d based on the me an TP c once ntration.  
 

 
1. Estimaterunoff

For a single-family residential land use, th

from Table 4-16:  

 

 TP = 0.327 mg /l (singl

2. Calculate TP loading to wet detention pond
 
 

After  the  dry retention pre-treatment, th

 6. Calculate depth of an
oxic conditions in pond
 
 
  Using the relationship expres
sed in Eq. 5, the depth of 
anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 
 
Depth of  DO < 1 = 3.035  x  Secchi  + 0.02
164 (chyl-a)  Œ  0.
004979  x  Total P 
 

 
  where: 

 

   Depth of DO < 1 = anoxic depth (m) 

 

   Secchi   = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

   chyl-a   = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

   Total P   = total phosphorus concentration (
g/l) 
 

 

 
Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035 
(1.15)  +  0.02164 (20.5)  
-  0.004979 (42)  =  3.73 m
  =  12.2  ft
 
    
 
 

If the pr oposed pond depth exceeds the estimated photic zone depth of 12.2 ft, 

aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 12.2 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the 
wat er col umn t o t he maxi mum pond dept
h.  The specific design of the required 
system should be selected by a qualified aeration specialist. 
 
As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
vol ume for collect

If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula

for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept

 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 12
.2 ft x 2/3 = 8.13 ft 
 

 Pond surface area = pond

1. DryRetention
 
 

 
A. Pensacola Project (Zone 1)
 
 
The required retention depth 
to achieve an annual removal efficiency of 95% in 
Zone 1 is determined from Table 6-4 (Z
one 1) based on DCIA percentage and the 
non-DCIA CN value.  For this project: 
 

   DCIA Percentage = 18.75% of developed area 

 

   Non-DCIA CN = 81.4 

 
The required dry retention depth is 
obtained by iterat
ing between DCIA 
percentages of 10 and 20, and for non-DCIA
 CN values between 80 and 90.  The 
required dry retention depth = 3.
66 inches over the developed area.
 
 
 
 
B. Orlando Project (Zone 2)
 
 
If the project was located in Orlando, th
e required dry rete ntion depth would be  
slightly different due to diffe
rences in the distribution of rain events.  The required 
retention depth would be 
obtained from Table 6-4 (Zone
 2) by iterating between 
DCIA percentages of 10 and 
20, and for non-DCIA CN values between 80 and 90.

2. WetDetention
 
 

 Treatment Train Approach
 
 
Calculati on of desi gn cri t eria for a wet deten
tion pond is based on determining the detention 
time required to achieve the 
desired pollutant removal efficiency of 95%.  For practical 
purposes, this efficiency is 
assumed to apply to nitrogen
 and phosphoru
s since other 
pollutants such as BOD and TSS are typically re
moved at a faster rate than nutrients.  
However, as discussed in Section 5.2.2, wet 
det ention systems are incapabl e of providi ng 
95% annual mass load reduction for either 
nitroge n or phosphorus, e ven at e xte nde d 
dete ntion time s (> 200 days).   
 
Therefore, when wet detention is desired as
 a treatment option, pr
e-treatment must be 
provided to enhance the total 
system performance efficiency 
to a minimum of 95% for both 
total nitrogen and total p
hos phorus.  Since dry retention prov
ides the best pr
e-treatment in a 
minimal space, dry retention ap
pears to be the pre-treatment 
system of choice for this 
application.  There are many 
combinations of dry retentio
n and wet detention which can 
provide the desired 95% removal. 
 
Assume that a wet detention 
pond is designed with a 
residence time of 100 days. 
 

 

Anticipated TN removal (Figure 5-11) = 
 
Anticipated TP removal (Figure 5-10) = 

 
Eff = 40.13 + 6.372 ln (t
d
) + 0.213 (ln t
d
)
2
 = 40.13 + 6.372 ln 
(100) + 0.213 (ln 100)
2
 = 70.5% 
 

 

 
Based on the estimated per for mance ef ficiency 
of the wet detention po
nd, the pond fails to 
meet the 95% remo val criteria for 
either TN or TP.  Therefore,
 the remaining efficiency is 
achieved using dry detention.  The required effici
ency for the dry reten
tion is calculated b y  
Eq. 1 below: 
 
 

Treatment Train 
Efficiency = Eff

  +  (1 Œ Eff

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18. 75% of develope d area  

  

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 1), the required removal ef

achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
3.50 and 3.75 inches.

2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic
s of the wet detention 
pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 
 
a. Calculateannualru
noff inputs to pond
 
 
The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 1). 
 

 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.304 

 

 The annual r ainfall for the Pensacol
a area = 65.5 inches
 (Appendix A.3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 65.5 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.304 = 149.34 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 94.7% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 94.7% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 149.34 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.947) = 7.92 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 100-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  7.92 ac-ft/ yr  x  1 
year/365 days  x  10
0 days  =  2.17 ac-ft 
 

 

 

 
b. Estimate maximum allowable pond depth
 
 
The maximum allowable pond depth is directly re
lated to the anticipated
 algal productivity 
within the pond.  Ass uming that wet dete
ntion ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited 
ecosystems, the productivity 
ca n be e stimate d based on the me an TP c once ntration.  
 

 
1. Estimaterunoff

For a single-family residentia
l land use, the event mean 
concentrati on (emc) for TP 
in runoff can be obtain
ed from Table 4-17: 
 

 TP = 0.327 mg /l (singl
e-family residential)

2. Calculate TP loading to wet detention pond
 
 

After  the  dry retention pre-treatment, th
e annual runoff input to the pond = 7.92   
ac-ft/yr 
 

 
  TP load to pond = 

 
 
 
3. Calculate TP concentration in pond
 
 
At the proposed 100- day residence time, 
the TP removal was pr
eviously estimated 
as 70.5% . 
 

  Annual mass of TP remaining in water column = 

 

   3.19 kg TP/yr  x  (1 
Œ 0.705)  =  0.94 kg TP/yr 
 
The remaining TP mass will be
 distributed between the po
nd volume and the annual 
outflow: 
 

   = 2.17 ac-fat  +  7.

The relationship between TP and chlorophy

by the following relationship: 
 

     ln (chyl -a)  =  1.058 l n
 (TP)  -  0.934   (Eq. 4)

the following relationship: 
 
 
where:  SD = Secchi dis k depth (m) 

 
chyl-a = chlorophyll-a (mg/m

 6. Calculate depth of an
oxic conditions in pond
 
 
  Using the relationship expres
sed in Eq. 5, the depth of 
anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 
 
Depth of DO < 1 = 3.035   x  S
ecchi  +  0.02164  x (chyl-a) 
 Œ  0.004979 
  x  Total P 
 

 
  where: 

 

   Depth of DO < 1 = anoxic depth (m) 

 

   Secchi   = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

   chyl-a   = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

   Total P   = total phosphorus concentration (
g/l) 
 

 

 
Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035 
(0.81)  +  0.02164  (38.4)  
-  0.004979 (72)  =  2.93 m
  =  9.6 ft
 
    
 
If the proposed pond depth 
exceeds the estimated photic
 zone depth of 9.6 ft, 
aeration or other mixing will be required fo
r areas deeper than 9.
6 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the

As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
vol ume for collect
ed solids.   
 
If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept
h of anoxia to demo
nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia. 
 

 
 
 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 9.6 ft x 2/3 = 6.40 ft 

 

 Pond surface area = pond
 volume/mean depth = 2.17 ac-ft/6.40 ft = 0.34 ac 
 

 

 

 
2B.    ORLANDO  (ZONE  2)  PROJECT
 
 

 

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the 
development characteristics: 

 

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18. 75% of develope d area  

  

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 2), the required removal ef
ficiency of 94.7% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
2.25 and 2.00 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.25 
inches, the treatment efficiency 
is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project conditions is 94.8
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.00 
inches, the treatment efficiency 
is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project conditions is 92.4
. 
 
By iterating between 2.00 inches (92.4%) and 2.25 
inches (94.8%), the dry retention depth required 
to achieve 94.7% rem
oval is 2.24 inches.

2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic

pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 

 
 
A. Calculateannualru

The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Orlando). 
 

 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.253 

 

 The annual rainfall fo
r th e Orlando area = 50.0 
inches (Appendix A. 3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 50.0 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.253 = 94.88 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 94.7% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 94.7% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 94.88 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.947) = 5.03 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 100-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  5.03 ac-ft/ yr  x  1 
year/365 days  x  10
0 days  =  1.38 ac-ft 
 
 

 

 
 
B. Estimatemaximum 
all owable pond depth
 
 
The maximum allowable pond depth is directly re
lated to the anticipated
 algal productivity 
within the pond.  Ass uming that wet dete

  TP load to pond = 
 
 

 
3. Calculate TP concentration in pond
 
 
At the proposed 100- day residence time,

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 3), the required removal ef
ficiency of 94.7% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth in ex
cess of 4 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 4.00 
inches, the treatment efficiency 
is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co

. 
 

The maximum retention depth of 4 inches listed in
 Appendix D fail
s to reach the required removal 
efficiency of 94.7% for t he retenti on porti on of the 
treatment train.  Since 
increasing the detention 
time of the wet detention 
pond will not significantly 
enhance the efficiency of the system, it is not 
possible to achieve the goal of 95% pollutant remo
val for both total nitrogen and total phosphorus 
for Zone 3 conditio

unreasonable dry rete

4. Estimation of Pre-Development Loadings
:  The total project site covers 100 acres, 
including 90 acres of rangeland/
forest and 10 acres of wetlands
.  Five acres of the on-site 
wetlands will be preserved and 5 acres will be incorporated into the project. 
 

 
A. Pre-Development Runoff Volume
 
 
(1)
 
Rangeland/Forest
:  From TR-55, the CN for 
rangeland (fair condition) in 
HSG D soils is 84 and the CN for fore
st areas (woods) is 82.  Assuming a 
50-50 mixture of rangeland and forest, the composite CN is: 
 

   Composite CN = 84 (rangeland)  x  0.5  +  82 (forest)  x  0.5  =  83 

 
From Appendix C, the annual runoff co
efficient for DCIA = 0 and CN = 
83 can be estimated by interpolation: 
 

    Pensacola (Zone 1) = 0.197 

    Orlando (Zone 2) = 0.140 

    Key West (Zone 3)= 0.159 

 

   

   From Appendix A.3, the annual 
rainfall depths for the 3 sites are: 
 

    Pensacola = 65.5 in/yr 

    Orlando = 50.0 in/yr 

    Key We st = 40.0 in/yr

   Annual runoff volumes
 for the 3 sites are: 
 

    Pensacola: 
 

90 acres x 65.5 in/yr x 1 ft/12 in x 0.197 = 96.78 ac-ft/yr
 
 

 
    Orlando: 

 

     90 acres x 50.0 in/yr x 1 ft/12 in x 0.140 = 52.5 ac-ft/yr
 
 

 
Key West: 
 

     90 acres x 40.0 in/yr x 1 ft/12 in x 0.159 = 47.7 ac-ft/yr
 
 

 
 
 

(2) Isolated Hardwood Wetland
:  
From TR-55, the CN for wooded areas 
(fair condition) in hydric 
soils (HSG D) is 82. 
 

 From Appendix C, the annual runoff 
coefficient for DCIA = 0 and CN = 
82 can be estimated by interpolation: 
 
Pensacola (Zone 1) = 0.185 
    Orlando (Zone 2) = 0.142 

    Key West (Zone 3)= 0.159 
 

 

 Based on a review of the site cond
itions (including wetland indicators and 
water level data) by the project biologi
st and engineer, it was determined 
that approximately 75% of the genera
ted runoff volume is retained in the 
wetland and 25% leaves the wetland as 
runoff.  Of the 10 acres of on-site 
wetlands, 5 acres will be preserved and 
5 acres will be incorporated into 
the development.  Calculations are

Calculate Treatment Requirements for Post
- Less Than or Equal to Pre-Loadings
 
 
Estimation of treatment requirements assumes th
at only dry retention 
and wet detention are 
capable of approaching the desi
red pollutant reduction goal. 
 

 
1. DryRetention:
   For dry retention, the removal effi
ciencies for TN and TP are identical 
since the removal efficiency is based on th
e portion of the annual runoff volume which is 
infiltrated.  The required removal is the larg
er of the calculated removal efficiencies for 
TN and TP. 
 

 
A. PensacolaProject:
   
For the Pensacola area, the annual load reduction is 63.2% 
for total nitrogen and 89.0% for total phos
phorus.  The design criteria is based on 
the largest required removal which is 89.
0%.  The required retention depth to 
achieve an annual removal efficiency 
of 89.0% in the Pensacola area is 
determined from Appendix D (Zone 1) 
based on DCIA percentage and the non-
DCIA CN value.  For this project: 
 

   DCIA Percentage = 18.75% of developed area 

 

   Non-DCIA CN = 81.4 

 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 1), th
e required removal efficiency of 89.0% is achieved 
with a dry retention depth between 2.50 and 2.75 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.50 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 88.9%
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.75 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 91.0%
. 
 
By iterating between 2.50 inches (88.9%) an
d 2.75 inches (91.0%
), the dry retention 
depth required to achieve 89
.0% removal is 2.51 inches.
 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
7-38 
 

 
B. OrlandoProject
:  
 For the Orlando area, the annual load reduction is 68.5% for 
total nitrogen and 90.5% for total phosphorus
.  The design criteria is based on the 
largest required removal which is 90.5%.  
If the project was lo
cated in Orlando, th e 
required dr y retention depth would be sligh
tly different due to 
differences in the 
distribution of rain events.  The required
 retention depth would be obtained fro m  
Appendix D (Zone 2) by iterating between 
DCIA percentages of 10 and 20, and for 
non-DCIA CN values between 80 and 90.  
 
From Appendix D (Zone 2), th
e required removal efficiency of 86.8% is achieved 
with a dry retention depth between 1.50 and 1.75 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 1.75 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 91.25%
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 1.50 inch, the tre atment e ffic ienc y is obtaine d by 

iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 88.9%
. 
 
By iterating betwee n 1.50 in
ch (88.9%) and 1.75 inches (91.25%), the dry retention 
depth required to achieve 91
.0% removal is 1.72 inches.
 
 

 

 

 

 
C. KeyWestProject:
For the Key West area, th
e annual load reduction is 61.4% 
for total nitrogen and 88.4% for total phos
phorus.  The design criteria is based on 
the largest required removal which is 88.4%.  If the project was located in Key 

West, the required dry retention depth would 
be slightly differ ent due to differ ences 
in the distribution of rain events.  The 
required retention depth would be obtained 
from Appendix D (Zone 3) by iterati ng be
twee n DCIA pe rce ntages of 10 and 20,  
and for non-DCIA CN values
 between 80 and 90.   
 
From Appendix D (Zone 3), th
e required removal efficiency of 88.4% is achieved 
with a dry retention depth between 2.50 and 2.75 inches. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.75 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 88.55%
. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 2.50 inches, 
t he treat ment  effici ency is obtained by 
iterating between DCIA percentages of 10
 and 20, and for non-DCIA CN values 
between 80 and 90.  The 
efficiency for the proj
ect conditions is 87.61%
. 
 
By iterating between 2.50 inches (87.6%) and 2.75 inches (88.55%), the dry 
retention depth required to achieve 88.4% removal is 2.71 inches.

2. WetDetention
 
 

 Treatment Train Approach
 
 
Calculati on of desi gn cri t eria for a wet deten
tion pond is based on determining the detention 
time required to 
achieve the post- <
 pre-pollutant removal effi ci
encies for TN and TP listed 
previously.  For practical purposes, this effi
ciency is assumed to 
apply to nitrogen and 
phosphorus since other pollutant
s such as BOD and TSS are t
ypically removed 
at a faster 
rate than nutrients.  As disc
uss ed in Section 5.2.2, wet de
tention systems are capable of 
providing a nnual ma ss loa d re duc tions for 
phosphorus in excess 
of 80% at extended 
detention times (> 200 days), but
 the removal efficiency for to
tal nitrogen in
 wet detention 
ponds appears to peak at approximately 45%.  As
 a result, wet detentio
n alone is not capable 
of achieving the requir
ed efficiencies of 88.4-90.5% 
for TP an d 6 1.4
-68.5% for TN. 
 
Therefore, when wet detention is desired as
 a treatment option, pr
e-treatment must be 
provided to enhance th
e total system performance efficien
cy to the minimum efficiencies 
necessar y to achieve post- <
 pre-loadings for TN and TP.  
Since dry retention provides the 
best pre-trea tme nt in a minimal spac e , dry rete
ntion appears to be the pre-treatment system 
of choice for this application.
  There are many 
combinations of dry retention and wet 
detention which can provid
e the desired removals. 
 
Assume that the primary compon

be a wet detention pond with 
a residence time  of 150 days.

Since a wet  detent ion p

betwee n the required re moval and

The r equired dry r etention volume is estimated 
from the tables given in Appendix D using the

   DCIA Perce ntage = 18. 75% of develope d area  

  

   Non- DCI A CN = 81.4 

 

 

 

 
1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 1), the required removal ef
ficiency of 36.0% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.00 and 0.25 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.25 inch, the treat
ment efficiency is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 38.0%
. 
 
By iterating between 0.25 inch (38.0%) and 0.00 inch (0.00%), the dry retention depth required to 
achie ve  36. 0% re mova
l is 0.24 inch.
 
 

Therefor e, the requir ed tr eat
ment train will consist of: 
 

a.
 
0.24 inch dr y retention, followed by 
b.
 
Wet detention pond with a 1
50-day mean residence time 
 
Based on the relationships given in Figures 5-9 an
d 5-10, the removal effici
encies for TN and TP 
increase little at dete
ntion times in  excess of 100-150 days
.  Although the pond size may be 
increased (if desired) for fill or 
other purposes, the required dry re
tention pre-treatment depth will 
not be significantly reduced.  Ho
wever, if the pond residence ti
me is decreased below 150 days, 
then the dry retention pre-treatment
 depth will increas
e correspondingly. 
 

 

 

 
2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic
s of the wet detention 
pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 
 
a. Calculateannualru

The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 1). 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT 
7-41 
 

 
 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.304 

 

 The annual r ainfall for the Pensacol
a area = 65.5 inches
 (Appendix A.3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 65.5 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.304 = 149.3 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 36.0% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 36.0% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond 
= 149.3 ac-ft/yr  
x  (1 - 0.360) = 95.55 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 150-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  95.55 ac-ft/yr  x  1 year/365 days
  x  150 days 
 =   39.27 ac-ft 
 

 

 

 
b. Estimate maximum allowable pond depth
 
 
The maximum allowable pond depth is directly re
lated to the anticipated
 algal productivity 
within the pond.  Ass uming that wet dete
ntion ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited 
ecosystems, the productivity 
ca n be e stimate d based on the me an TP c once ntration.

For a single-family residentia

At the proposed 150- day residence time,

  Annual mass of TP remaining in water column = 

 

   38.53 kg TP/yr  x  (1

This mass will be distribute

by the following relationship: 
 

     ln (chyl -a)  =  1.058 l n
 (TP)  -  0.934   (Eq. 4) 
 
 
  

  where:  chyl-a =  chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m

 6. Calculate depth of an
oxic conditions in pond
 
 
  Using the relationship expres
sed in Eq. 5, the depth of 
anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 

 
 
Depth of DO < 1 = 3.035  x  Secchi + 0.0216
4  x  (chyl-a) Œ 0.004979  x  Total P 
 

 
  where: 

 

   Depth of DO < 1 = anoxic depth (m) 

 

   Secchi   = Secchi disk depth (m) 

 

   chyl-a   = chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m

) 
 

   Total P   = total phosphorus concentration (
g/l) 
 

 

 
Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035 
(1.01)  +  0.02164 (25.7)  
-  0.004979 (52)  =  3.37 m
  =  11.1 ft
 
    
 
If the proposed pond de pth e xc eeds the e s
timated anoxic zone depth of 11.1 ft, 
aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 11.1 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the 
wat er col umn t o t he maxi mum pond dept
h.  The specific design of the required 
system should be selected by a qualified aeration specialist. 
 
As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
vol ume for collect
ed solids.   
 
If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept
h of anoxia to demo
nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia.

From Appendix D (Zone 2, the re

1.  Required Dry  Retent ion Dept h
 
 

From Appendix D (Zone 3), the required removal ef
ficiency of 32.9% is 
achieved with a dry 
retention depth between 
0.00 and 0.25 inch. 
 
For a dry retention depth of 0.25 inch, the treat
ment efficiency is obtained by iterating between 
DCIA perce ntages of 10 and 20, an
d for non-DCIA CN values betwee
n 80 and 90.  The efficiency 
for the project co
nditions is 42.9%
. 
 
By iterating between 0.00 inch (0.0%) and 0.25 inch
 (42.9%), the dry retent
ion depth required to 
achie ve  32. 9% re mova
l is 0.19 inch.
 
 
Therefor e, the requir ed tr eat
ment train will consist of: 
 

a.
 
0.19 inch dr y retention, followed by

dete ntion pond with a 150-
day mean residence time 
 
 

 

 
2.  Wet Detention Pond Characteris tics
 
 

The required physical characteristic
s of the wet detention 
pond are determined based on the desired 
residence time and the impacts of the proposed dry retention pre-treatment. 
 
 
A. Calculateannualru
noff inputs to pond
 
 
The annual runoff coefficient for 
the development can be estimate
d using the tables included 
in Appendix C (Zone 3). 
 

 
 For: DCIA = 18.75%  an
d non- DCIA CN = 81.4 
 

 The estimated ﬁCﬂ value is obtained 
by iteration as discusse d previously.  
 

 Annual C Value = 0.266 

 

 The annual rainfall for the Key West
 area = 40.0 inches
 (Appendix A.3) 
 
 Annual generated runoff volume =  

 
90 acres x 40.0 i nches/year x 1 ft/ 1
2 inches x 0.266 = 79.8 ac-ft/yr 
 
 

The calculated efficiency of 32.9% for the dr
y retention pre- tr eatment means that 32.9% of 
the annual runoff volume w
ill be infiltrated into the ground
 and will not disc
harge directly 
into the wet detention pond.  The annual runo
ff volume whic h reaches
 the pond is calculated 
as: 
 

  Annual Inputs to Pond
 = 79.8 ac-ft/yr  x  (1 
- 0.329) = 53.55 ac-ft/yr 
 

 

 For a 150-day residence time, the pond volu me will be: 

 

  53.55 ac-ft/yr  x  1 year/365 days
  x  150 days 
 =   22.01 ac-ft

B. Estimatemaximum 
all owable pond depth
 
 
The maximum allowable pond depth is directly re
lated to the anticipated
 algal productivity 
within the pond.  Ass uming that wet dete
ntion ponds are primarily phosphorus-limited 
ecosystems, the productivity 
ca n be e stimate d based on the me an TP c once ntration.  
 
 
1. Estimaterunoff
 characteristics
 
 
For a single-family residential land use, th
e emc for TP in runoff can be obtained 
from Table 4-17:  

 

 TP = 0.327 mg /l (singl
e-family residential) 
 

 

 
 

 
2. Calculate TP loading to wet detention pond
 
 

After  the  dry retention pre-treatment, th
e annual runoff input 
to the pond = 53.55 
ac-ft/yr 
 

 
  TP load to pond = 
 
 

 
3. Calculate TP concentration in pond
 
 
At the proposed 150- day residence time, 
the TP removal was pr
eviously estimated 
as 77.4% . 
 

  Annual mass of TP remaining in water column = 

 

   21.60 kg TP/yr  x  (1
 Œ 0.774)  =  4.88 kg TP/yr 
 

 
This mass will be distribute
d within the pond 
permanent pool volume (22.01 ac-ft) 
and the pond outflow.   Assu
ming that inflow and outflo
w are approximately equal, 
the outflow volume is 53.55 ac-ft.

4. Calculate mean chloroph
yll-a concentration in pond
 
 
The relationship between TP and chlorophy
ll-a in a Florida waterbody is expresse d 
by the following relationship: 
 

     ln (chyl -a)  =  1.058 l n
 (TP)  -  0.934   (Eq. 4) 
 

 

  where:  chyl-a =  chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m
3
) 
 

    TP = total P concentration (
g/l) 
 

 
ln (chyl -a)  =  1.058 
 ln (52)  -  0.934 
 
chyl-a  =  e

  =  25.7  mg/m

 6. Calculate depth of an
oxic conditions in pond
 
 
  Using the relationship expres
sed in Eq. 5, the depth of 
anoxic conditions
 within the 
pond can be estimated as follows : 
 
 
De pth of DO < 1 = 3. 035  x   Se

Depth  of  DO < 1  =  3.035

 = 11.0 ft
 
    
 
 

If the pr oposed pond depth exceeds the estimated photic zone depth of 11.0 ft, 

aeration or other mixing will be
 required for areas deeper 
than 11.0 ft to maintain a 
well mixed water column.  The aer ation or 
mixing must be sufficient to mix the 
wat er col umn t o t he maxi mum pond dept
h.  The specific design of the required 
system should be selected by a qualified aeration specialist. 
 
As an alternative to providing aeration 
or mixing within the pond, the required 
permanent pool volume could be considered
 as only the volume above the anoxic 
zone and not the entire volume
 of the pond.  Areas below 
the anoxic depth would be 
considered as dead storage, although thes
e areas would provide a significant storage 
vol ume for collect
ed solids.   
 
If the pond is modified, based 
on the results of the calcula
ted anoxic zone depth, the 
calcul ations would need to be redone to 
estimate new values 
for total phosphorus, 
Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll-a, and dept
h of anoxia to demo
nstrate that the new 
design meets the required permanent pool volume above the zone of anoxia. 
 

 

 

 
 
 7. Estimate pond dimensions
 
 
For  the estimation of pond dimensions, 
assume that the mean depth (pond 
volume/pond area) is 2/3 of the maximum depth. 

 

 Mean pond depth = 11
.0 ft x 2/3 = 7.3 ft  
 

 Pond surface area = pond
 volume/mean depth = 22.01 
ac- ft/7.3 ft = 3.02 ac

7.4   Conclu sions
 
 

7.4.1 DryRetention
 
 
 The design examples illustrated in the pr evious
 sections are intended 
to present alternative 
stormwater designs whic
h will meet both the 80% 
and 95% pollutant reduction goals outlined in 
Chapter 62-40 FAC as well 
as a condition of no net increase in
 pollutant loadings for a developed 
site under post-development cond
itions.  The design examples pr
ovide calculations for treatment 
systems comprised exclusively of dry retention as 
well as a combination of 
wet detention with dry  
retention pre -treatme nt.  The hypothe tical site c ons
ists of a 100-acre rangeland/forest parcel which 
is converted into a single-family residential co
mmunity with a DCIA percentage of 18.7% and a 
non-DCIA curve num
ber of 81.4. 
 

 A comparison of existing and proposed dry re
t ention stormwat er tr
eatment requirements, 
based upon the hypothetical 100-acre parcel, is give
n in Table 7-1 for development s in Pensacola, 
Orla ndo, a nd Ke y West.  Existing require me nts fo
r dry retention stormwater treatment at the  
Pensacola site are based upon the FDEP criteria
 outlined in Chapter 62-25 FAC.  Dry retention 
stormwater treatment requirements
 for the  Orla ndo site are ba se
d upon SJRWMD design criteria, 
while dry retention treatment re
quirements for the Key West s
ite are based upon SFWMD design 
criteria.
