 A large number of stormwater monitoring studi
es have been conducted within the State of 
Florida as part of the NPDES Program.  Stormwater
 samples collected as part of this program are 
restricted to a well defined range of rainfall de
pths and antecedent dry period conditions.  Although 
this information may be useful in comparing runoff characteristics between major metropolitan 

areas, the sampling protocols required by this progr
am do not necessarily provide accurate estimates 
of the average annual runoff concentrations for a 
given pollutant discharging from various land use 
categories.  These values can only be estimated 
by monitoring a wide range of rainfall depths and 
antecedent dry period conditions.  As a result, data 
collected as part of th
e NPDES Program are not 
utilized to estimate runoff characteristics for the purposes of this evaluation. 

 

 Studies included in development of stormwater
 characterization data cover the period from 
1977-2005.  Runoff concentrations of many parameters
 appear to be relatively consistent for a 
particular land use over this period with the excepti
on of lead.  Concentrations of lead in studies 
conducted prior to 1980-1990 are generally much 
greater than post 1980-1990 studies, presumably 
due to reductions of lead content in gasoline 
over this same period. Recent research conducted by 
ERD indicates that concentrations of total l
ead in stormwater runoff measured since 1990 are 
substantially lower than values measured prio
r to 1990.  Therefore, it is assumed that lead 
concentrations presented in pre-1990 studies are not
 representative of current conditions and are not 
included in estimation of mean runoff characteristics of lead. 

 

 In general, the objective of the literature re
view is to provide estimates of event mean 
concentrations (emc) for each study included in th
e stormwater characterization database.  When 
applied on an annual basis, the event mean concentration is defined as follows: 
 
 
 
In essence, this value reflects a flow-weighted 
average concentration for a given parameter over 
an annual cycle.  When the emc is multiplied by the estimated total annual runoff volume, it 

provides an estimate of the annual mass loadi
ng discharging from the evaluated land use 
category for a given pollutant. 
 

 
4.1.2 Single-FamilyResidential
 
 
 Single-family residential land use is define
d as a typical detached home with lot sizes 
generally less than 1 acre and dwelling densities gr
eater than 1 dwelling unit per acre.  Duplexes 
constructed on one-third to one-half acre lots are al
so included in this category.   This type of 
land use is characterized by a moderate degree of impervious area, generally ranging from 

approximately 20-40%. Hydrologic characteristics 
for the identified single-family residential 
stormwater characterization studies are given in
 Table B.1 (Appendix B).  Watershed areas for 
the identified characterization studies range fr
om 7.39-897 acres, with impervious percentages 
ranging from 6.1-65.0%.

 A summary of mean stormwater characteristic
s from single-family residential stormwater 
studies is given in Table 4-4.  Each of the studi
es included in Table 4-4 provide characterization 
data for total nitrogen and total phosphorus.  However, nutrient concentrations measured at the 

Orlando Duplex site by Harper (1988) appear to 
be substantially elevated, particularly when 
compared with total phosphorus values measured at
 the remaining sites.  The measured emc of 
1.69 mg/l for total phosphorus at this site is a clear
 outlier in the data set and is not included in 
estimation of the mean emc values for total phosphorus.  The total nitrogen emc of 4.62 mg/l at 

this site also appears to be elevated but is not
 a clear outlier value.  Therefore, this value is 
retained for estimation of the mean emc for tota
l nitrogen.  Total nitrogen emc values range from 
1.02-4.62 mg/l, with an overall mean of 2.07 mg/l.
  Total phosphorus emc values range from 
0.102-0.510 mg/l, with an overall mean of 0.327 mg/l. 
 All but one of the listed studies provides 
characterization data for BOD, with 13 of the 17 studies including information for TSS.
