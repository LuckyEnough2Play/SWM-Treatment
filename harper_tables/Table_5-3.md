Conversely, the second entry in Table 
5-3 summarizes a study conducted on a dry 
detention pond in Orange County, FL.  The underdra
in for this pond was constructed several feet 
below the average groundwater table elev
ation surrounding the pond.  For this reason, 
groundwater continually flowed from the su
rrounding area into the underdrain system and 
directly into the adjacent receiving waterbody.  
The excess groundwater discharge resulted in a 
net export of total nitrogen, orthophosphorus, to
tal phosphorus, and BOD for this treatment 
facility. 
 

Based on the research performed on dry dete
ntion with filtration and dry detention 
systems, it is apparent that a majority of the 
mass removal effi ciencies are due to infiltration 
through the pond bottom and not due to removal 
processes occurring within the treatment 
facilities.  Ponds with bottoms  constructed a
bove the seasonal high groundwater table elevation 
will exhibit higher mass pollutant removal efficien
cies than ponds constructed into the seasonal 
high groundwater table.

Maximum removal efficiencies for a dry detention system could be achieved using a 
design which incorporates infiltration through 
the pond bottom and forces the remaining inputs 
into the underdrain system to pass through the 
filter media, while maintaining an underdrain 
elevation at least 1 ft above the seasonal high 
groundwater table.  This system would utilize 
infiltration and filtration as the primary removal mechanisms. 
 

It appears that annual mass removal efficienci
es for dry detention with filtration systems 
are highly variable.  However, in order to provide
 comparative pollutant removal efficiencies for 
common stormwater management systems, theo
retical pollutant removal efficiencies are 
assumed for dry detention with filtration syst
ems based upon the assumption that 25% of the 
annual runoff volume which enters the pond infiltr
ates through the pond bottom.  The estimated 
mass removal efficiencies for a dry detention w
ith filtration system, based upon this assumption, 
is estimated to be approximately 30% for tota
l nitrogen, 40% for total phosphorus, 90% for TSS, 
and 50% for BOD.  These removal efficiencies ma
y improve slightly if the treatment volume is 
increased beyond the standard design.  Since th
e primary removal mechanism is the physical 
process of sedimentation of particles, the in
creased detention time provided by the additional 
treatment volume has the potential to increase sy
stem efficiency.  However, most of the 
settleable solids should be removed very quickly
 and little additional removal may occur at the 
extended detention time. 
 

 
5.1.4 Off-lineRetention/Detention
 
(Dual Pond) Systems
 
 
Off-line retention/detention systems provide an off-line retention pond for the treatment 
volume and an on-line detention pond for flood cont
rol and attenuation of peak discharges.  A 
diversion device, often called a "smart box", is used
 to divert first-flush stormwater runoff into 
the retention pond.  When the retention pond fills, 
the remaining stormwater runoff is diverted 
directly to a detention pond for flow attenuation purposes. 
 

A schematic diagram of an off-line retention/
detention system is given in Figure 5-4. 
Volume recovery in the retention portion of 
the system occurs primarily through groundwater 
infiltration and evaporation.  Drawdown in the detention pond occurs through an outlet structure 

designed to match pre- and post-development di
scharge rates.  Off- line retention/detention 
systems have been used sporadically throughout
 Florida, although these systems are required 
within the City of Orlando.  Even though this type
 of system requires two ponds rather than one, 
the required ponds are typically much smaller in size than a single pond, and can be placed into a 

development landscape more easily than a singl
e large system, minimizing potential impacts on 
space requirements.   
 

Off-line retention/detention systems provide pollutant removal mechanisms in both the 
retention system as well as the detention portion 
of the pond.  Stormwater runoff retained in the 
retention system infiltrates through the gr
ound with 100% removal efficiency.  Removal 
processes such as settling, adsorption, and precipita
tion reactions occur in the detention facility 
during the drawdown period and al
so provide similar mass removal efficiencies to the dry 
detention system.

A summary of treatment efficiencies for o
ff-line retention/detention systems based on 
studies conducted within the State of Florida is gi
ven in Table 5-4.  Only two studies have been 
conducted in the State of Florida which provide
 pollutant removal efficiencies for off-line 
retention/detention systems.  Each of thes
e studies was conducted by Harper (1988) in the 
Orlando area on residential and commercial watershe
ds, constructed within the City of Orlando, 
which provided a treatment volume of 0.5 inches over the contributing watershed area. 
 

Excellent removal efficiencies were achieve
d in the study reported by Harper (1988) in 
the Orlando residential watershed.  Measured removal efficiencies for total nitrogen, total 

phosphorus, TSS, BOD, total copper, and total zinc were equal to 85% or more.  Removal 

efficiencies measured in the commercial wate
rshed studies are somewhat lower than those 
reported in the residential watershed.  Removal 
efficiencies for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, 
TSS, and BOD measured in this study were 30%, 76%, 89%, and 64%, respectively.  
 

Mean values for the two studies are reported 
at the bottom of Table 5-4.  On an average 
basis, off-line retention/detention facilities provi
de excellent removal efficiencies for total 
nitrogen, total phosphorus, TSS, BOD, and heavy metals.  Annual removal efficiencies for this 

type of system can be expected to be approximately 60-65% for total nitrogen and total copper; 

75-85% for total phosphorus and total lead; and 80-90% for TSS, BOD, and total zinc.
