4.1.4 Low-Density Residential (Rural)
 
 
 Low-density residential land use is defined 
as a rural type community with lot sizes 
generally greater than one acre and less than one 
dwelling unit per acre.  These areas are typically 
characterized by low traffic volum
es and runoff coefficients along with relatively low pollutant 
loading rates.  The majority of these land areas
 are pervious surfaces covered by grass or wooded 
areas with only a small percentage of impervious area. 

 

 Low-density rural residential land use is 
the only general land use category for which 
specific loading rate studies were not found during th
e literature search.  However, this type of land 
use is basically a mixture of the categories of
 single-family residential and open space since 
vegetated areas in the low-density category are of
ten left in a natural condition typical of open 
spaces.  Therefore, for purposes of this evaluati
on, runoff characteristics for low-density residential 
areas are estimated as the arithmetic mean of the m
ean values for single family residential (Table 4-4 
and open space (Table 4-12).

4.1.5 Low-Intensity Commercial Areas
 
 

 For the purposes of this evaluation, the term 
intensity refers to the level of use of the 
commercial area rather than an indication of the t
ype of business or density of development.  Low-
intensity commercial areas are defined as areas 
which receive only a moderate amount of traffic 
volume and where cars may be parked during the day for extended periods of time.  Since most 

commercial activities themselves generate relatively 
little pollutant loading, the majority of pollutant 
deposition occurs as a result of automobiles and trucks operating within the commercial area.  Low-

intensity commercial areas include schools, church
es, professional office sites, and small shopping 
centers.  High-intensity commercial areas include
 downtown business districts and large regional 
shopping areas. 

 

 A summary of hydrologic characteristics fr
om low-intensity commercial stormwater 
characterization studies is given in Table B.3.  Nine
 separate studies were identified in the available 
literature, with watershed areas ranging from 2.17-
50.70 acres.  Percentage imperviousness for the 
commercial sites range from 60% to approximately 
100%.  Eight of the nine studies utilize curb and 
gutter stormsewer systems, with swales utilized 
for drainage conveyance at the Florida Aquarium 
site. 

 

 A summary of mean stormwater emc values
 from low-intensity commercial stormwater 
studies is given in Table 4-7.  
Characterization data for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and TSS are 
provided for each of the nine studi
es, with eight of the nine studies providing characterization data 
for BOD.  As observed in previous land use categor
ies, characterization data for heavy metals is 
somewhat limited.  In general, low-intensity co
mmercial areas are characterized by relatively low 
levels of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and B
OD, although TSS concentrations are somewhat 
elevated.  Runoff characteristics reported by Harper
 and Herr (1993) are not included in calculation 
of the mean value since the runoff in this study r
eceived pre-treatment in a vegetated swale prior to 
collection.
