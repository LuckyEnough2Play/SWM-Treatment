 The relationship between removal efficiency 
of total phosphorus in wet detention ponds as a 
function of residence time is given in Figure 5-9.  The removal efficiency of 90% for total 

phosphorus with a 14-day residence time, provided 
by Rushton, et al. (1995), was removed from the 
data set as an outlier due to substantially elevated
 values for the Student T and Cook™s D parameters. 
 The best-fit relationship for the remaining data
 was obtained using a second-order relationship 
involving the natural log of the detention time.  
The best-fit equation is provided on Figure 5-9 for 
the relationship between removal efficiency and residence time.  This equation provides an 

extremely good fit between the two variables, with an R
2
 of 0.897.  This value indicates that 
residence time explains approximately 90% of the 
observed variability in removal effi ciencies for 
total phosphorus in wet detention ponds.  The re
maining variability is probably explained by 
experimental errors involved in the various studies
 and differences in the chemical composition of 
phosphorus species entering the various ponds.  In ge
neral, phosphorus species such as particulate 
phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) are 
removed relatively rapidly in wet detention 
ponds, while organic phosphorus is removed at a substantially lower rate.

 The relationship indicated on Figure 5-9 s
uggests that removal of phosphorus in wet 
detention ponds continues to occur, although at a 
progressively slower rate, with increases in 
residence time within the system.  A removal effici
ency of 80% can be achieved at a detention time 
of about 200 days.  The upper limit for removal effi
ciencies in wet detention ponds appears to be 
approximately 90%, although removal efficiencies 
in excess of 90% were achieved at extended 
detention times in three of the 20 studies.   At this point, total phosphorus concentrations within wet 

detention ponds appear to approach irreducible 
concentrations which reflect natural background 
phosphorus levels in surface waterbodies. 
 
 Relationships between detention time and removal efficiencies for total nitrogen in wet 

detention ponds are illustrated on Figure 5-10.  The 
data points presented on this figure are based 
upon the referenced studies summarized in Table 5-
9.  The annual mass removal efficiency of 63% 
reported by Rushton, et al. (1995) for a wet pond with
 a detention time of 14 days and the removal 
efficiency of 33% for a 2-day detention time were eliminated from the data set as outliers due to 

elevated values for the Student T and Cook™s D parameters.

   FunctionofResidenceTime. 

 

 
 
 

 The best-fit for the relationship between rem
oval effi ciency and detention time for total 
nitrogen was obtained using a hyperbolic equation.  Th
e final version of this equation is summarized 
on Figure 5-10.   The R
2
 value of 0.800 suggests that detention time explains approximately 80% of 
the observed variability in removal efficiencies for total nitrogen in wet detention ponds.  The 

remaining variability in removal efficiencies for to
tal nitrogen is likely due to variability in methods 
of analysis between the listed studies as well as 
variability in the dominant nitrogen form present in 
the stormwater inflows.  In general, 
inorganic forms of nitrogen (ammonia and NO
x
) and particulate 
nitrogen are removed relatively rapidly in wet dete
ntion ponds.  The initial rapid removal of nitrogen 
within the first 10-20 days, indicated on Figure 5-
10, is probably a result of the rapid uptake of 
inorganic nitrogen and the settling of particulate sp
ecies.  Other forms of nitrogen, such as organic 
nitrogen, are removed at a substantially slower rate and are likely responsible for the dramatic 

slowdown in removal efficiency observed for total nitrogen after approximately 20-30 days. 

 

 The hyperbolic relationship summarized on Figur
e 5-10 indicates that a removal efficiency 
of approximately 40% can be achieved for total n
itrogen in 50 days, with a maximum efficiency of 
approximately 45% at extended detention periods.   
The lack of additional removal efficiencies for 
total nitrogen observed at extended detention times
 is probably a reflection of either phosphorus 
limitation or that irreducible concentrations of total nitrogen have been achieved within the pond.

 The relationships summarized in Figures 5-
9 and 5-10 suggest that wet detention ponds 
designed in the South Florida Water Management Di
strict with extended detention times in excess 
of 200 days are likely to achieve approximately
 80-85% removal for total phosphorus and 40-45% 
removal for total nitrogen on an annual basis.  A
lthough the estimated removal efficiencies for total 
phosphorus meet the goal of 80% removal for stor
mwater management systems outlined in the 
Water Resource Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40 FAC), removal of total nitrogen in wet 

detention ponds, even at extended detention periods, still fails to meet the 80% goal. 

 

 
5.2.3 DryDetention
 
 
 As discussed in Section 5.1.3, dry detention syst
ems, constructed with or without filtration/ 
underdrain systems, exhibit highly variable remova
l efficiencies which are influenced to a large 
extent by the relationships between the seas
onal high groundwater table elevation and the pond 
bottom.  Detention systems which provide infiltra
tion for a large portion of the runoff inputs have 
exhibited substantially higher removal efficiencies 
than detention systems which are constructed at 
or below the groundwater table elevation.  Because
 of the high degree of 
variability in removal 
efficiencies observed for dry detention systems, th
ere is no presumption that these systems will meet 
the outlined goals of the Water Resource Implementation Rule for stormwater management systems. 

 This fact has been recognized by the St. Johns Ri
ver and South Florida Water Management Districts 
which now discourage the use of dry detention syst
ems (with or without filtration/underdrains) in 
new development.  Since other stormwater manageme
nt options are available, such as dry retention 
or wet detention, which provide reliable and predicta
ble pollutant removal efficiencies, dry detention 
systems should be eliminated as a common stormwat
er management technique within the State of 
Florida.

SECTION  6 
 

 RECOMMENDED  MODIFICATIONS 
TO  EXISTING  STORMWATER 
DESIGN  CRITERIA
 
 
 

 This section provides an analysis of potentia
l modifications to existing stormwater design 
criteria within the State of Florida to meet 
the performance objectives outlined in the Water 
Resource Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40 FA
C).  This rule requires that stormwater 
management systems achieve at least an 80% re
duction of the average annual load of pollutants 
that would cause or contribute to violations of 
State water quality standards.  If the stormwater 
management system discharges to a desi
gnated OFW or other protected waterbody, the 
performance criteria increases to a 95% reduction. 
 Based on the analyses presented in Section 
5.2, with the exception of the SMRWMD design 
criteria for on-line dry retention, existing 
stormwater design criteria fail to consistently m
eet either the 80% or 95% target goals outlined 
in Chapter 62-40.  

 

 In addition to modifications required to
 achieve the 80% and 95% pollutant load 
reduction goals, an analysis is also provided in 
this section of the design criteria necessary to 
achieve a condition of no net increase in pollutant 
loadings for a developed site compared with 
loadings which would have reasonably been 
thought to discharge from the site under pre-
development conditions.  Implementation of these 
criteria would ensure that land developments 
do not cause a net degradation of water resources w
ithin the State.  This objective is supported in 
Chapter 62-40.341 in the section titled ﬁStormwater 
Management Programﬂ, which states that 
ﬁthe primary goals of the State™s Stormwater 
Management Program are to maintain, to the 
maximum extent practical, during and after cons
truction and development, the pre-development 
stormwater characteristics of a site;  –ﬂ. 

 

 The analyses presented in the subsequent 
sections are provided for total nitrogen and 
total phosphorus which are two of the most common pollutants in urban runoff. Although total 

suspended solids (TSS) is also a significant constitu
ent in stormwater runoff, the removal of TSS 
within stormwater management systems occurs at a much more rapid rate than is commonly 

observed for either total nitrogen or total phosphor
us.  Therefore, if a stormwater management 
system provides the required removal efficiency
 for both total nitrogen and total phosphorus, the 
system will easily provide the same pollutant removal efficiency for TSS. 

 

 Another common constituent in stormwat
er runoff is biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD).  Inputs of BOD into surface water can cau
se oxygen depletion, resulting in fish kills and 
changes in aquatic diversity.  Upon entering an 
aquatic environment, organic matter is rapidly 
degraded by a variety of microorganisms within the water.  The degradation and removal 

processes for BOD in surface waters have b
een well documented, and removal of BOD as a 
function of time has been shown to observe the following first-order equation:

 BOD decomposition constants (K) in surface 
waters are temperature-dependent but are 
typically on the order of 0.1/day.  A graphical re
presentation of the theoretical removal of BOD 
as a function of time, based upon a decomposition 
constant of 0.1/day, is given in Figure 6-1. 
This relationship can be used to estimate the 
time required to achieve a certain BOD removal 
efficiency within a wet detention pond.  A removal 
efficiency of approximately 80% is achieved 
for BOD after a residence time of 
approximately 15 days, with removal efficiencies in excess of 
95% after approximately 30-35 days.  As a result, 
the removal of BOD in aquatic systems occurs 
at a much more rapid rate than removal of to
tal nitrogen or total phosphorus, as indicated in 
Figures 5-10 and 5-11.  Therefore, if a stormw
ater management system provides the required 
removal efficiency for both total nitrogen and total phosphorus, the system will also easily 

provide the same pollutant removal efficiency for BOD.

 The recommended design criteria discussed in 
this section include only dry retention and 
wet detention as potential stormwater manageme
nt options.  Based on the discussion presented 
in Section 5, these systems provide predictable a
nd consistent pollutant removal efficiencies for 
a wide range of stormwater pollutants.  For purposes
 of this analysis, the term ﬁretentionﬂ can be 
used to mean a dry pond, swales, underground exf
iltration, or any other practice which provides 
for recovery of a specified stormwater treatment volume by infiltration into the soil or 

evaporation.  Dry detention stormwater management
 systems, either with or without filtration/ 
underdrains, are not included as a viable stormwater
 management alternative in this section.  As 
discussed previously, dry detention systems 
are characterized by highly variable removal 
efficiencies which depend heavily upon construc
tion of the system with respect to the 
groundwater table elevation.  Dry detention sy
stems which have performed well in field 
evaluations have performed similar to dry reten
tion basins, while poor removal efficiencies have 
been achieved in dry detention systems with little or no infiltration. 

 

 
6.1  Design Criteria to Achieve 80% Removal
 
 

6.1.1 Dry Retention Systems
 
 
 Since a first-flush effect is not assumed for 
this analysis, removal of 80% of the pollutant 
mass is achieved by retention of 80% of the annua
l runoff volume.  Estimates of the retention 
volume required to achieve 80% removal of the annual stormwater runoff volume was calculated 

for each of the five meteorological zones and 
a variety of DCIA percentages and non-DCIA 
curve numbers.  This information was extracted fr
om the performance efficiency tables for dry 
retention provided in Appendix D which were u
tilized to find the required retention depth to 
achieve an annual treatment efficiency of 
80% or more for each combination of DCIA 
percentage and non-DCIA curve numbe
r.  If the treatment efficiency for a given combination of 
retention depth, DCIA percentage, and non-DC
IA curve number exceeded 80%, the retention 
depth was interpolated using the next lower re
tention depth to achieve an estimated annual 
treatment efficiency of exactly 80% for each 
combination of DCIA percentage and non-DCIA 
curve number. 

 

 A summary of required retention depths to 
achieve an annual mass removal efficiency of 
80% for dry retention systems is given in Table 
6-1 for each of the five 
meteorological zones. 
The state-wide average is provided at the top of 
Table 6-1.  On a state-wi
de average, retention 
depths necessary to achieve an annual removal efficiency of 80% range from 0.22-1.92 inches of 

runoff, depending upon the combination of DCIA 
percentage and non-DCIA curve number.  The 
retention depths necessary to achieve 80% remova
l efficiency are lowest in the Central zone 
areas, with the highest retention depths required in the Panhandle areas.   

 

 A graphical illustration of state-wide averag
e retention depths required to achieve an 
80% annual removal efficiency as a function of
 DCIA percentage and non-DCIA curve number 
is given in Figure 6-2.  Increases in the DCIA
 percentage and non-DCIA curve number clearly 
result in increases in the required retention 
depth necessary to achieve an 80% annual mass 
removal efficiency.
