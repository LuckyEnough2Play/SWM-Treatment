 Under existing conditions, the dr y retention 
treatment requirement 
for the hypothetical 
development, assuming that the development does not
 disc harge to an OFW,  
would be 0.5 i nch of 
retention for the Pensacola and Key 
West sites.  At the Orlando s
ite, the dry retention requirement 
wo uld be 0.5 inch for 
an off-line system and 1.00 inch
 for an on-line sy
stem.  Retention 
requirements necessary to achieve an 80% reduction in the annual r unoff volume, assumed to be 

equivalent to an 80% pollutant removal efficiency
, are indicated under the column designated as 
ﬁrequiredﬂ.  To achieve an 80% pollutant removal 
in the Pensacola area, th
e dry retention system 
would have to provide a treatment volume of 1.52 
inches of runoff.  In
 the Orlando area, the 
required dr y retention tr eatment volume would be 
0.94 inch, with a dry retention requirement of 
1.66 inches in th
e Key West area.

 As se en in Table 7-1, the  existing de sign crite
ria for dry retention in the Pensacola and Key 
West areas fall well short of the 
actual dry retention treatment vol
ume required to achieve an 80% 
annual pollutant r emoval ef fici
ency.  For a project designed in
 the Orlando area, based upon 
SJRWMD design criteria, the dry re
tention requirement for an off-line 
system would fail to meet the 
80% pollutant removal goal, while the pollutant re
moval goal would be ex
ceeded by an on-line 
retention system with 1.00
 inch of dry retention. 
 

 Exi sting and proposed dry retenti on requireme
nts are also provided fo
r developmen
ts which 
dischar ge to OFWs which are assumed to be de
signed according to the 95% pollutant reduction 
target goal outlined in Ch
apter 62- 40 FAC.  The applicable desi
gn criteria for e
ach of the three 
project areas is 50% additional dry retention tr
eatment volume above th
e amount necessary to 
achieve 80% pollutant removal.  For projects de
signed in the Pensacola and Key West areas, this 
treatment volume requirement become
s 0.75 inch.  If a 
development is constructed in the Orlando 
area,  the  current dry rete ntion re quire me nt bec omes 
0.75 inch for off-line sy
stems and 1.50 inch for 
on-li ne syst ems.  However, t he act ual dry retenti
on treatment requirements necessary to achieve a 
95% pollutant removal far exceed the existing dry 
retention treatment requirements.  Dry retention 
requirements for 95% pollutant removal are 3.66 inch
es for the Pensacola area,
 2.45 inches for the 
Orlando area, and 3.62 in ches
 for the Key West area.   
 

 Dry retention requirements 
necessary to achieve post <
 pre-development loadings are 
summarized at the bottom of
 Table 7-1.  The required removals 
necessary to achieve no net increase 
in loadings for total nitr
ogen range from 61.4-68.5%.  These va
lues indicate that a pollutant removal 
efficiency of 80% is not required fo
r total nitrogen to achieve no net 
increase in pollutant loadings.  
Required removal efficiencies for total phosphorus 
to achieve no net increase in pollu tant loadings 
range from 88.4-90.5% , suggesting that stormwat
er management systems designed for an 80%  
pollutant removal will fa
il to achieve post <
 pre-development loadings fo
r total phosphorus.  Based 
upon these values, it is apparent 
that a stormwater management sy
stem designed to achieve 80% 
pollutant removal will remove more 
than the required amount of tota
l nitrogen, while 
removing less 
than the required amount of total phosphorus.  
A stormwater management
 system designed to 
achieve a true 95% reduction in po
llutant loadings will re
move substantially mo
re total nitrogen and 
total phos phorus  than requ
ired to achieve post <
 pre-development loadings.   
 
 Based upon the comparative info
rmati on summari zed in Table 7-
1, it appears that designing 
stormwater management systems to
 achieve an arbitrary pollutant
 removal goal for both total 
nitrogen and total ph
osphorus is an ineffective 
method for achieving comp
liance with water quality 
or anti-degradation criteria.  A much more effe
ctive method of addressi
ng st ormwat er treat ment  
requirements appears to be designs based upon post <
 pre-development loadings.  The pr oposed dry 
retention requirements necessary 
to achieve this goal for the hypot
hetical  projects range from 1.67 
inches in the Orlando area to 2.42 inches in the 
Pensacola area.  These values are greater than the 
actual dry retention requirements necessary to 
achieve an 80% pollutant removal goal, but are 
substantially less than the dry retention requireme
nts necessary to achieve a 95% pollutant removal 
goal .  If post <
 pre-development criteria are utilized, th
ere would be no need for supplemental  
design criteria for discharges into OFWs since a
ll projects would result in
 no net increase in 
pollutant loadings into the recei
ving waterbody.  However, it should be noted that the post <
 pre-
development dry retention design criteria liste
d at the botto m of Table 7-1 are based upon th e 
removal efficiencies required for 
total phosphorus.  Since all cons
tituents are removed at the same 
rate using dry retentio
n, an excess removal would still be
 achieved for total nitrogen.

7.4.2 WetDetention
 
 
 A comparison of existing a
nd proposed wet detention stor mwater treatment requirements to 
achieve the evaluate
d design objectives is given in Tabl
e 7-2.  Under exis
ting conditions, wet 
detention systems designed in th
e Pensacola area according to FDEP
 design criter ia must have a 
treatment volume equivalent to 1.00
 inch of runoff over the project
 area.  The FDEP design criteria 
do not specify requirements for detention time.  
The project constructed in
 the Orlando area would 
be designed accor ding to SJRWMD cr
iteria.  These criteria specify a 
treatment volume of 1 inch of 
runoff, with a minimu m 14-day wet season detenti
on time and a maximum pond depth of 12 feet.  
The project constructed in the Key We st area 
would be designed acco
rding to SFWMD design 
criteria whic h specify a treatment 
volume of 1 inc h of runoff, with no spec ified detention time and 
25-50% of the pond depth gr
eater than 12 feet.   
 
 A summary of propose d we t dete ntion desi
gn criteria necessary 
to achieve the 80% 
pollutant removal goal is provided in Table 7-2.  
For this analysis, the trea
tment volume is assumed 
to be the same as under 
existi ng desi gn criteri a.  
Although this treatment vo
lume is often termed the 
ﬁwater qualityﬂ component of 
the system, it has very little imp
act on the overall performance 
efficiency of the system and prim
arily regulates the drawdown charact
eristics of the 
pond following 
a storm event.  The design example assumes a we
t detention pond wit h a 
detention pond of 150 
days since this design tends to maximize rem
oval effi ciencies for ni
trogen and phosphorus.  
However, lower dete ntion time s could also be
 used, although this would increas e treatment 
requirements for  other  portions of the over all tr eatment tr ain. 

 
 Although wet detention ponds ca n provide a re
moval  effici ency of 80
% or more for total 
phosphorus at extended detention 
times, wet detention ponds are not
 capable of providing an 80% 
pollutant removal for total nitrogen.
  As a result, r etention pre- treat
ment will be required to increase 
the overall performance efficiency 
of the system to 80% for to tal nitrogen.  Based on th e analyses 
presented in the previous sections
, this will require a dry retention 
pre-treatment of 
0.81 inch in the 
Pensacola area, 0.49 inch in the Orlando area, a
nd 0.75 inch in the Key West area.  Under the 
alternative design, the maximum 
depth for each pond is based 
upon predicted water quality 
characteri sti cs and t he anticipated depth of anoxi a
 within the pond rather 
than an arbitrary depth 
standard.  Ponds whic h ar
e constructed deeper than the anticipated depth of anoxia may require 
supplemental aeration or circulation to maintain ae
robic conditions.  It should be noted that, while 
this design will meet the 80% pollu
tant removal goal for total nitroge
n, the overall pollutant removal 
for total phosphorus will
 substantiall
y exceed 80% . 
 
 Wet detention design criteria to achieve a 95% pollutant removal ar e also summar ized in 

Table 7-2.  Under existing design criteria, the 
tr eatment volume would be increased by 50% for  
each of the three projects, while
 other component s of
 the wet detention 
pond woul
d remain 
unchanged.  Under the proposed alternative we
t detention design, the treatment volumes are 
assumed to be the same as those provided unde
r existing conditions since the treatment volumes 
have  little  impact  on  overall system performan
ce.  The example summarized in a previous section 
utilizes a 100-day detention pond, 
although other deten
tion times could be u
tilized as well.  The 
remaining dr y retention pre-treatment necessar y to 
boost the overall per f or ma
nce of the system to 
95% ranges fr om 2.42 inches in the Orlando area to
 greater than 4 inches in the Key West area.  
These relatively large dry retent
ion requirements are necessary 
primarily to boost the removal 
efficiency for total nitrogen to 
95%, while the removal efficien
cy for total ph
osphorus will 
substantiall
y exceed 95% .
