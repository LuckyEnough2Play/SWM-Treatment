6.1.2 WetDetention
   
 
 Wet detention systems provide reliable and pr
edictable pollutant removal efficiencies and 
can play a significant part in stormwater manage
ment for virtually any type of development. 
However, as discussed in Section 5.2, wet dete
ntion ponds with short detention times (14-21 
days) fail to achieve the 80% pollutant removal 
efficiency for either total nitrogen or total 
phosphorus.  Wet detention ponds designed with extended detention periods can achieve the 

80% removal criteria for total phosphorus, but will 
fail to achieve this efficiency for total 
nitrogen. Therefore, if 80% removal is necessary
 for total nitrogen, wet detention ponds must be 
used as part of a treatment train approach to
 achieve the target removal efficiency for both 
nitrogen and phosphorus.   
 

A summary of recommended design criteria for we
t detention ponds is given in Table 6-3.  
Based upon the information presented previously, 
the most important factor in regulating the 
performance efficiency of a wet detention pond is
 the residence time for runoff inputs within the 
system.  Assuming that short circuiting does not occu
r, residence time is determined primarily by the 
permanent pool volume, and this volume becomes 
the single most important design parameter for 
wet detention ponds.  The required volume of the 
permanent pool can be calculated based upon the 
removal relationships presented previously in
 Figures 5-9 (total phosphorus) and 5-10 (total 
nitrogen).  Design criteria are also listed for the treatment volume, which represents the water 

volume stored on top of the permanent pool during an individual rain event.  Pond requirements for 

treatment volume and recovery time for the treatment volume are based upon current water 

management district criteria. 
 

Design criteria for pond depth are based upon the an
ticipated depth of the anoxic zone within 
the pond based on the anticipated productivity of th
e pond.  This concept is discussed further in 
Section 6.4.  No restrictions are placed on the conf
iguration of the pond, provided that the inlet and 
outlet from the system are located as far apart as 
possible to maximize travel path.  In addition, it is 
recommended that at least 20% of the pond surface be
 planted with a littoral zone consisting of a 
combination of submergent and emergent aquatic ve
getation.  Creation of a littoral zone will create a 
more diverse environment and will probably enhance the overall performance efficiency of the wet 

detention system.
