4.1.11 Mining/Extractive Land Use
 
 
 The category of mining/extractive land use in
cludes a wide variety of mining activities for 
resources such as phosphate, sand, gravel, clay, and sh
ell.  Very little informa
tion is available in the 
current literature concerning the runoff characteristics of this land use type with the exception of 

site-specific studies generated as a result of wate
r quality violations and enforcement actions.  The 
only reference which provides runoff characteriza
tion data for mining/extractive land use is the 
Boggy Creek Study by the East Central Florida 
Regional Planning Council (ECFRPC) in 1988. 
This study assumes that very little pollution is 
generated from the actual mining operation, and 
runoff characteristics primarily reflect contributions
 from access roads, parking areas, and office 
sites.  This assumption appears reasonable for many types of mining activities which generally 

extract materials from isolated pit areas.  A su
mmary of hydrologic data from the ECFRPC study is 
given in Table B.11.  Although the wa
tershed size is not presented in the study, the percentage of 
impervious area is estimated to be 23%. 

 

 A summary of stormwater emc values from 
mining/extractive land use studies is given in 
Table 4-16.  Information is provided in the B
oggy Creek study only for total nitrogen and total 
phosphorus, with a mean total nitrogen concentr
ation of 1.18 mg/l and a mean total phosphorus 
concentration of 0.15 mg/l.
