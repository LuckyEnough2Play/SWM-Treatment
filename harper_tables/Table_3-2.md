A comparison of the mean number of annual 
rainfall events at each of the designated 
regional sites is given in Figure 3-5.  The highest number of annual events occurs at the Miami 

monitoring site, with approximately 158 events measured each year.  The smallest number of 

annual rain events occurs at the Cross City mon
itoring site, with a mean of 104 events measured 
per year.

3.3  Antecedent Dry Period
 
 
 An evaluation of mean antecedent dry peri
od was also conducted for the individual rain 
events measured at each of the selected regional 
monitoring sites.  This information was evaluated 
on both a dry season (October-May) and wet seas
on (June-September) basis.  Information on 
antecedent dry period is useful in evaluating recovery times for stormwater management systems 

which must recover stored treatment volumes prior to the next significant rain event.

 A comparison of mean antecedent dry periods fo
r rain events at the selected regional sites 
during dry and wet season conditions is given in 
Table 3-3 and Figure 3-6.  Mean antecedent dry 
periods between rain events range from 3.03-5.63 
days under dry season conditions, with an overall 
average of 4.12 days.  Under wet season conditions, mean antecedent dry periods range from 1.42-

2.27 days with an overall mean of 1.89 days.

SECTION  4 
 

 STORMWATER  RUNOFF Å’ 
QUALITY  AND  QUANTITY
 
 
 

 The performance efficiency and effectiven
ess of stormwater treatment systems are 
closely linked to the quantity and quality of the ge
nerated stormwater stream.  Issues related to 
the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff form
 the basis of existing stormwater treatment 
design criteria.  A discussion of the quality a
nd quantity of stormwater runoff generated by 
various land use categories is given in the following sections. 

 

 
4.1  Water Quality Characteristics
 
 

4.1.1 DataAvailability
 
 
 A multitude of stormwater characterization studi
es have been conducted within the State of 
Florida as part of research projects, permit m
onitoring requirements, retrofit projects, and NPDES 
permitting.  Land use categories included in runoff ch
aracterization studies can typically be grouped 
into one of 12 general land use designations wh
ich are commonly used in pollutant loading 
evaluations.  A summary of these general land use categories is given in Table 4-1. 

 

 When performing pollutant loading studies for 
large watershed areas, land use information is 
often obtained as FLUCCS codes (Florida Land Use 
Code and Classification System).  This system 
typically provides multiple sub-categories for each 
of the 12 general land use categories summarized 
in Table 4-1 based upon differences in percen
tage imperviousness, vegetative cover, and 
development density.  Unfortunately, detailed runoff 
characterization data are not available for most 
of these sub-categories.  As a result, when pe
rforming pollutant loading studies, detailed land use 
categories represented by FLUCCS codes must ofte
n be assigned to one of the 12 general land use 
categories summarized in Table 4-1 for estimation 
of pollutant loadings.  This assignment is 
typically performed based upon anticipated sim
ilarities in hydrologic and pollutant loading 
characteristics between the detailed FLUCCS code designations and the general land use categories. 

 

 A summary of the availability of runoff charact
erization data for various pollutant categories 
and land use types is given in Table 4-2.  Good runo
ff characterization data is generally available for 
suspended solids in each of the land use categorie
s summarized in Table 4-1.  A similar level of 
characterization data availability is present for 
total nitrogen and total phosphorus in virtually all 
land use categories.  However, information on 
dissolved species of nitrogen and phosphorus is 
relatively limited in the existing literature.
