As indicated previously, wet detention system
s must be utilized as part of a treatment 
train to achieve the required 80% removal efficiency specified under the Water Resource 

Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40).  When treatme
nt systems are used in series as part of a 
treatment train, the efficiency of the overall treat
ment train can be calculated using the following 
equation: 
 
 

 
Overall Treatment Train Efficiency (decimal)  =  Eff
1
  +  (1 Å’ Eff
1
)  x  Eff
2  
(Eq. 1) 
 
 

 

where: 

 

 Eff
1
 = effi ciency of initial treatment system (decimal) 
 

 Eff
2
 = efficiency of second treatment system (decimal) 
 

 

 

After treatment in the initial system, a load reduc
tion has occurred which is a function of the type 
of treatment provided.  After migrating through th
e initial treatment system, the remaining load 
consists of mass which was not removed in the 
initial system.  This mass is then acted upon by 
the second treatment system with an efficiency a
ssociated with the particular type of system 
used. The overall efficiency can then be calculated according to the above equation. 
 
To achieve an overall annual mass load reduction of 80% using wet detention, a pre-
treatment system must first be used to provi
de a significant portion of the desired pollutant 
removal effectiveness.  For example, assume
 that a wet detention pond is designed with a 
detention period of approximately 50 days which is
 sufficient to achieve a removal efficiency of 
approximately 40% for total nitrogen.  Utilizing the relationship summarized as Eq. 1, and 

assuming that the efficiency of the wet detention system for total nitrogen (40%) is represented 

by Eff
2
, the effi ciency of the initial treatment system (Eff
1
) would need to be 67% to achieve an 
overall treatment efficiency of 80%. 
 

Depending upon the characteristics of the de
velopment and the meteorological region, 
achieving an initial 67% annual mass load reduc
tion using retention will require between 0.25-
0.75 inch of dry retention as pre-treatment.  Wh
en pre-treatment is provided and the remaining 
stormwater is discharged into the wet deten
tion pond, the overall treatment system will achieve a 
mass removal effi ciency of 80% for total nitr
ogen.  The mass removal efficiency for total 
phosphorus and other significant pollutants will be substantially in excess of 80%.

 6.2  Design Criteria to Achieve 95% Removal
  
 

6.2.1 DryRetention
 
 
An evaluation of required retention depths to 
achieve an annual removal efficiency of 95%, 
corresponding to the OFW criteria outlined in the 
Water Resource Implementation Rule (Chapter 
62-40), was performed using the same methodology ou
tlined previously for evaluation of retention 
criteria based upon an 80% annual mass load reducti
on.  To achieve an annual mass load reduction 
of 95%, it is assumed that 95% of the annual runoff volume must be removed by the retention 

system.  A summary of required retention depths to
 achieve an annual removal efficiency of 95% for 
each of the five zones is given in Table 6-4.  
Treatment depths necessary to achieve 95% annual 
pollutant mass removal range from 2.99-3.98 inches 
of retention over the project area, based upon 
location and variations in DCIA percentage and non-DCIA curve number.   
 
Variations in required dry retention depth to
 achieve 95% removal on a state-wide average 
basis are illustrated on Figure 6-5. 
 The lowest retention depths necessary to achieve 95% annual 
mass removal occur at low values for DCIA percen
tage and non-DCIA curve number.  However, as 
DCIA percentages and non-DCIA curve numbers in
crease, retention treatment requirements also 
increase, approaching values ranging from 3.2-3.4 in
ches of retention.  Similar to the trends 
observed with the analysis for 80% removal, a higher than average retention depth is necessary in 

the Panhandle and Florida Keys to achieve a 95% 
removal, while a lower than average retention 
depth would be necessary in Central areas. 
 
 

6.2.2 WetDetention
 
 
As indicated in previous sections, wet deten
tion systems are not capable of providing a 95% 
pollutant removal efficiency for either total nitr
ogen or total phosphorus, even at extended detention 
periods.  Therefore, to achieve the 95% removal obj
ective for discharges to OFWs, a treatment train 
approach must be used with wet detention used 
in series with a high efficiency pre-treatment 
management technique.  
 

To achieve an overall annual mass load re
duction of 95% using wet detention, a pre-
treatment system must be used to provide a significant portion of the desired pollutant removal 

efficiency.  As an example, assumed that a wet detention pond is designed with a detention period of 

approximately 50 days which is sufficient to achieve
 a removal efficiency of approximately 40% for 
total nitrogen.  Using the relationship summarized as
 Eq. 1, and assuming that the efficiency of the 
wet detention system for total nitrogen (40%) is represented by Eff
2
, the efficiency of the initial 
treatment system (Eff
1
) would need to be 92% to achieve an
 overall treatment efficiency of 95%. 
When pre-treatment is provided and the remaining st
ormwater is discharged into the wet detention 
pond, the overall treatment system will achieve a mass 
removal efficiency of 95% for total nitrogen. 
However, the mass removal for total phosphorus and 
other significant pollutants will be in excess of 
95%.
