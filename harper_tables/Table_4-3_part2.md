Runoff collected from mixed residential and commercial watersheds 
during 1978 using manual and automatic techniques.  Data presented 

in both concentration and loading rate forms but represents mixed 

land use.

Metals 
Runoff samples collected from June to October 1978 only for storms 
of intensity equal to or exceeding 1.
0 inch/hour.  Data cannot be used 
for loading rate estimation since typical less intens e storm events 

were not monitored.

General Parameters, 
Nutrients, Metals 
Four runoff events were collected from separate residential and 
commercial watersheds from July to November 1978 using manual 

flow-weighted collection techniques.  Data presented in both 

concentration and loading rate forms.  However, the data base is 

small and covers only a portion of th
e year.  Residential area receives 
heav

 traffic volume from ad
j
acent downtown area.
Yousef, et al.

Orlando, FL Interstate Highway (I-4)General Parameters, 
Nutrients, Metals 
Runoff from highway bridges was collected from 11 storm events 
during August 1975.  Data presented in  concentration form only.  

Sampling program and hydrologic information sufficient to generate 

annual loadings, but data is specific to bridge or highway runoff
