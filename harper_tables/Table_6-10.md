Estimates of annual runoff depths for typical
 developed land use categories and hydrologic 
soil groups are summarized in Table 6-11.  These 
values are calculated by multiplying the annual 
runoff coefficients (summarized in Table 6-10)
 by the annual average rainfall for each of the 
designated meteorological zones. 
 

Estimates of annual mass loadings of total n
itrogen and total phosphorus for typical land use 
categories were calculated by multiplying the es
timated annual runoff volume generated by each 
developed land use category and soil type times 
the recommended runoff characterization data for 
total nitrogen and total phosphorus summarized 
in Table 4-17.  Annual runoff volumes were 
estimated for a theoretical 1 acre parcel by multiplying the annual runoff coefficients (summarized in 

Table 6-10) times the mean annual rainfall for each meteorological zone.  This value was then 

multiplied by the typical concentrations summarized
 in Table 4-17 for total nitrogen and total 
phosphorus to obtain estimates of annual mass loadi
ngs for a wide variety of developed land use 
categories and hydrologic soil group types. 
 

Calculated annual total nitrogen loadings for 
typical land use categories are summarized in 
Table 6-12.  The values summarized in these tables reflect the estimated annual total nitrogen load 

discharging from each evaluated land use category 
and soil group type.  In general, total nitrogen 
loadings increase as the intensity of developm
ent increases and soil permeability decreases. 
Calculated annual total phosphorus loadings for t
ypical land use categories are summarized in Table 
6-13.  The values summarized in this table are cal
culated in the same manner as that previously 
described for total nitrogen.  In general, estimated
 annual total phosphorus loadings also increase as 
the intensity of land development increases and soil permeability decreases. 

 
 
6.3.3 Estimated Annual Removal Efficiencies
 
 
Required annual removal efficiencies were 
calculated to reduce the estimated annual 
loadings of total nitrogen (summarized in Table 
6-12) and total phosphorus (summarized in Table 6-
13) to values equal to or less than the estimated
 annual mass loadings of nitrogen and phosphorus for 
undeveloped/natural areas summarized in Table 
6-8.  This analysis was conducted for each 
evaluated land use category, soil type, and meteorological zone. 
 

A summary of required removal efficien
cies to achieve post-development <
 pre-
development loadings for total nitrogen is given in Table 6-14.  In general, required removal 

efficiencies for total nitrogen range from a
pproximately 54-99%, depending upon the particular 
combination of land use category and soil type.  
The largest required removal efficiencies are 
required for multi-family and commercial areas. 
 

Required removal efficiencies to achieve post-development <
 pre-development loadings for 
total phosphorus are summarized in Table 6-15.  Re
quired removals for total phosphorus range from 
approximately 82-99%, depending upon the specific 
combination of land use type, hydrologic soil 
group, and meteorological location.
