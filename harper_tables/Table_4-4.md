 Heavy metal characterization data from the residential land use studies is relatively 

limited, with the greatest amount of data availabl
e for copper, lead, and zinc.  However, as 
discussed in Section 4.1.1, lead concentrations
 measured prior to 1990 are excluded from 
estimation of overall mean concentrations, substantially reducing the available data set for this 

parameter. 

 

 As seen in Table B.1, five of the 17 stor
mwater characterization sites utilize grassed 
swales exclusively for conveyance of stormwat
er runoff, while seven of the stormwater 
characterization sites use curb and gutter systems exclusively.  The remaining sites use a 

combination of swale and curb and gutter system
s.  A comparison of runoff characteristics for 
residential sites utilizing grassed swales and curb/
gutter drainage systems is given in Table 4-5.  
With the exception of total phosphorus, runoff char
acteristics collected from residential areas 
utilizing grassed swales appear to be subs
tantially lower in value than observed for 
characterization sites utilizing curb and gutter syst
ems.  Overall, runoff collected from grassed 
swale drainage systems was approximately 38% lo
wer for concentrations of total nitrogen, 48% 
lower for BOD, 46% lower for TSS, 47% lower fo
r copper, and 23% lower for zinc than mean 
values measured at monitoring sites which utilized curb and gutter systems. 

 

 An analysis of variance comparison was 
conducted between the two data sets to 
determine if the observed differences in runo
ff concentrations between grassed swales and 
curb/gutter sites are statistically significant.  
This analysis was conducted only for total nitrogen, 
total phosphorus, BOD, TSS, copper, and zinc due to the limited data sets available for the other 

parameters.  None of the differences in concen
trations were found to 
be significant at a 95% 
probability level.  However, the observed differen
ces in total nitrogen concentrations were found 
to be statistically different at a 91% probability 
level, with a 77% probability level for significant 
differences in BOD concentrations, a 86% proba
bility level for significant differences in TSS 
concentrations, and a 75% probability level for si
gnificant differences in copper concentrations. 
However, the overall number of data points available for this analysis is limited which makes 

detection of significant differences between the data sets more difficult.
