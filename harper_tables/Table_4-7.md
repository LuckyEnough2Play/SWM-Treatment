4.1.6 High-Intensity Commercial Areas
 
 
 High-intensity commercial land use consists of commercial areas with high traffic volume 

and relatively constant traffic moving into and out 
of the area.  For purposes of this evaluation, high-
intensity commercial areas include downtown busine
ss districts and large regional shopping areas. 
This land use category is typically characterized 
by a high degree of imperviousness, with values 
often in excess of 90%. 

 

 A summary of hydrologic characteristics from 
high-intensity commercial stormwater studies 
in Florida is given in Table B.4.  Watershed sizes
 for the characterization studies range from 28-83 
acres, with impervious percentages ranging from 
96.4-98%.  Four separate studies were obtained 
from the literature search which includes a re
gional shopping mall, a downtown commercial area, 
and commercial areas with heavy traffic volume. 

 

 A summary of mean stormwater emc values from high-intensity commercial stormwater 

studies is given in Table 4-8.  
Each of the four studies provides characterization data for total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus, while only half of th
e studies provide characterization data for BOD 
and TSS.  Each of the studies also provides char
acterization information for lead and zinc, although 
all of the studies which provide data for lead 
were performed prior to 1990 and not useful for 
estimating current lead characteristics in runoff.  As
 seen in Table 4-8,  runoff characteristics from 
high-intensity commercial areas are substantially hi
gher for virtually all evaluated parameters than 
observed in the low-density commercial studies.
