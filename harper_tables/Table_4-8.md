 Information concerning stormwater characteriza
tion data from light industrial areas is very 
limited in the existing literature.  Only three studi
es could be identified which specified industrial 
park land use.  Two of these studies were performed during the 1980s, with the final study 

performed during 2002.

 A summary of hydrologic characteristics from th
e industrial stormwater studies is given in 
Table B.5.  Watershed area and percent impervious
 area are not available 
for two of the three 
studies, with only impervious percentage provided for the final study.   

 

 A summary of emc values from industrial land us
e areas is given in Table 4-9.  In general, 
industrial areas are characterized by relatively low 
concentrations of total nitrogen and BOD, with 
more elevated concentrations of total phosphorus and TSS.
