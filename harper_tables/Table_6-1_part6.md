 Variations in required dry retention depth to achieve 80% removal in the Central zone are 

illustrated on Figure 6-3 as an example of an 
area with lower than average retention depth 
requirements.  Required dry retention depths in 
the Central zone area range from approximately 
0.22-1.43 inches depending upon the combination of
 DCIA percentage and non-DCIA curve 
number.  Variations in required dry retention 
depth to achieve 80% removal in the Panhandle 
area are illustrated on Figure 6-4 as an example of
 an area with higher than average retention 
depth requirements.  At high values for DCIA
 percentage and non-DCIA curve number, the 
retention depth required to achieve 80% removal 
is substantially greater in the Panhandle region 
than in the Central region.  As discussed previ
ously, these variations are primarily due to the 
differences in the distribution of typical rain events. 
 
 A summary of recommended design criteria fo
r dry retention ponds to achieve an annual 
removal efficiency of 80% is given in Table 
6-2.  Recovery of the required treatment volume 
must be achieved within 72 hours or less, equiva
lent to the volume recovery period utilized for 
generation of the performance efficiency tables
 summarized in Appendix D.  Ability of the pond 
to achieve this recovery rate must be certified 
by a registered geotechnical engineer.  All side 
slopes and bottom areas of the pond must be seeded
 or sodded with water-tolerant grass species 
grown on sandy soils.  If sod is used as the 
vegetative cover on the bottom of the pond, changes 
in permeability of the basin resulting from the sod must be included in evaluation of the recovery 

period for the pond.  Inlets and outlets must be lo
cated as far apart as possible to prevent short-
circuiting.  Oil and grease skimmers must be
 provided at all outfall structures.  Other 
requirements related to side slopes, fencing, maintenance berms, and access will adhere to 

applicable local agency criteria.
