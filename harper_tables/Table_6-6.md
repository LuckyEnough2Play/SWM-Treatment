Estimates of annual runoff depths for undevel
oped/natural areas were calculated using the 
methodology outlined in Section 4.2.1 for each of the 
five meteorological zones and four hydrologic 
soil groups.  A summary of calculated runoff depths 
for undeveloped/natural areas is given in Table 
6-7 for each of the five meteorological zones.  Th
e runoff depth presented for each zone is calculated 
by multiplying the annual C value for each hydrologic soil group (summarized in Table 6-6) times 

the mean annual rainfall for each zone.  The values summarized in Table 6-7 reflect estimates of the 

long-term mean annual runoff depth for undeveloped/na
tural areas in each of the five zones based 
upon available rainfall data.  A relatively high degree 
of variability is apparent in calculated annual 
runoff depths for undeveloped/natural areas in each 
of the five zones.  The degree of variability 
appears to be greatest for soils in HSG A, with 
decreases in variability observed for less permeable 
soil types.
