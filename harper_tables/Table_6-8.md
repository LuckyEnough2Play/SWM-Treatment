6.3.2 Estimation of Post-Development Pollutant Loadings
 
 
When a stormwater management system is designed to provide sufficient treatment so that 
the post-development loadings from a parcel are e
qual to or less than the pre-development loadings 
from the parcel, the post-development loadings
 would be calculated based upon the specific 
hydrologic and land use characteristics of the site, combined with the anticipated pollutant removal 

effectiveness of the proposed stormwater treatment 
option.  However, for purposes of this analysis 
and to provide estimates of the magnitude of pollu
tant removal efficiencies necessary to achieve no 
net increase in pollutant loadings following deve
lopment, calculations of estimated annual mass 
loadings for nitrogen and phosphorus were perfor
med for ﬁtypicalﬂ residential and commercial 
developments, including low-density residential, singl
e-family residential, high-density residential, 
and commercial land use categories.

A summary of hydrologic assumptions used for th
e developed land use categories is given in 
Table 6-9.  The low-density residential areas are 
assumed to have approximately 15% impervious 
area, with 5% of the area as 
DCIA.  Hydrologic characteristics are provided for single-family 
residential developments based on 25% impervious
 and 40% impervious conditions.  High-density 
residential areas are assumed to be 65% impervi
ous, with 80% impervious assumed for commercial 
activities.  Highway land use categories are al
so included, based upon 50% and 75% impervious 
assumptions. Curve numbers for pervious areas ar
e based on soil types and assumptions regarding 
landscaped conditions.
