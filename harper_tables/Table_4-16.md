4.1.12 Wetlands
 
 
 Land uses assigned to the category of wetla
nds include a wide range of diverse wetland 
types, such as hardwood wetlands, cypress 
stands, grassed wetlands, and mixed wetland 
associations.  Wetland systems are routinely in
cluded in ongoing monitoring efforts, and wetland 
characterization data is available throughout the St
ate of Florida for a variety of wetland types. 
 

 When wetland characterization data is required, 
it is best to obtain regionally-specific data 
for the type of wetland system being evaluate
d.  Wetland characterization is available through 
STORET, water management districts, FDEP, and local governmental monitoring agencies.

 The hydrology of wetlands can be extremely 
complex, varying from flow-through wetlands 
which discharge throughout much of the year
, to depressional wetlands which discharge 
infrequently.  When including wetlands in pollu
tant loading evaluations, the site-specific 
hydrologic characteristics of the wetlands under evalua
tion must be considered.  As a result of the 
complexities of wetland systems, guidelines c
oncerning representative concentrations and 
hydrologic characteristics of wetlands are not included in this analysis. 

 

 
4.1.13 OpenWater/Lakes
 
 
 The final land use category, open water/lakes, c
onsists of open waterbodies such as lakes, 
reservoirs, streams, and rivers.  Pollutant con
centrations from these sources are a result of 
discharges from the waterbody during and follo
wing rain events.  The discharge from the 
waterbody is a mixture of runoff contributed 
from the surrounding watershed and the ambient 
water quality characteristics of the waterbody.  Wate
rbodies often provide pollutant attenuation for 
watershed areas which are tributary to the waterbody. 

 

 Characterization data is currently availabl
e for a large number of waterbodies located 
within the State of Florida.  These data ar
e easily available through STORET, the LAKEWATCH 
Program at the University of Florida, water ma
nagement districts, FDEP, and local governmental 
agencies.  In many cases, specific water quality data
 may be available for larger waterbodies which 
may be included in a pollutant loading analysis.  
Due to the abundant availability of site-specific 
data, recommendations on representative water quality characteristics for open water/lake land uses 

are not provided in this analysis. 
 

 
4.1.14 Recommended Characterization Data
 
 
 A summary of literature-based runoff character
ization data for general land use categories 
in Florida is given in Table 4-17 based upon the info
rmation provided in the previous sections.  The 
values summarized in this table represent the m
ean emc values for each of the general land use 
categories discussed previously. 

 

 In general, the data summarized in Tabl
e 4-17 reflect a pattern of increasing runoff 
concentrations with increasing land use intensity. 
 Of the three types of residential land uses 
summarized in Table 4-17, the lowest emc values ar
e associated with low-density residential. 
Increases in emc values occur when the land use inte
nsity is increased to single-family residential, 
and further increases occur as the intensity is 
increased to multi-family.  A similar pattern is 
apparent between low- and high-intensity commerc
ial areas, with higher emc values reflected for 
high-intensity commercial areas for each of the listed parameters.  Land use categories which are 

not expected to be a significant source of nitroge
n or phosphorus loadings, such as industrial and 
highway areas, are characterized by relatively low con
centrations for these parameters.  In contrast, 
agricultural areas, which would be expected to ha
ve elevated concentrations of nutrients, are 
characterized by higher concentrations of nutrients, particularly for total phosphorus.
