4.1.8 Highway/Transportation
 
 
 Highway/transportation land use consists prim
arily of major highway systems, such as 
interstate highways, expressways, and major stat
e and federal highway systems.  In general, 
highway systems included under this category are cons
idered to be heavily traveled, with constant 
traffic movement throughout the day.  This land us
e category is typically characterized by a high 
degree of imperviousness. 

 

 A summa ry of hydrologic information fr
om highway/transportation stormwater 
characterization studies is given in Table B.6.  Elev
en  runoff characterization studies were identified 
in the literature review, with watershed areas ranging from 1.3-58.3 acres and impervious 

percentages ranging from 36-100%.  Approximately half
 of the studies represent interstate highway 
systems, with the remaining studies reflecting majo
r 4- or 6-lane highways.  All of the systems 
provide drainage by curb and gutter systems. 

 

 A summary of emc values from highway/transpor
tation stormwater studies is given in Table 
4-10.  Each of the 11 studies provides information 
for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, with five 
studies providing information for BOD and eight
 studies providing information for TSS.  A 
relatively large number of the studies also in
cluded measurements of heavy metals, including 
cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, nickel, lead, a
nd zinc.  In general, highway/ transportation 
stormwater appears to have moderate levels of
 total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and TSS, with a 
relatively low level for BOD.  Stormwater concentra
tions of copper and zinc appear to be somewhat 
elevated compared with concentrations measured in other land use categories.
