Figure 5-5.   Calculated Annual Mass Removal E
fficiencies for 0.5 inch of Dry Retention for 
a Development with 40% DCIA and a non-DCIA Curve Number of 70. 
 

 

 

Isopleths for state-wide average removal effi
ciencies using 0.5 inch of dry retention for 
various DCIA percentages and non-DCIA curve 
numbers are illustrated on Figure 5-6 based on 
the combined data set for the 45 meteorological st
ations with hourly precipitation data.  At low 
values for DCIA and non-DCIA curve numbers, rem
oval efficiencies approach or exceed 80%. 
However, as the DCIA percentage and non-DCIA 
curve number increase, the removal efficiency 
for 0.5 inch of dry retention decreases rapidly. 

 

 For projects with impervious percentages in
 excess of 40%, the retention design criterion 
within the St., Johns River (for off-line system) and South Florida Water Management Districts 

becomes 1.25 inch of runoff from the impervious area.  For a project with an impervious 

percentage of 80%, which is near the upper e
nd of impervious coverage allowed under most 
zoning regulations, the required retention depth would be: 

 
 
 
Retention Depth  = 1.25 inches  x  0.8  =  1.00 inch

Calculated annual mass removal efficiencies
 for a dry retention pond with a treatment 
volume equivalent to 1 inch of runoff are al
so listed in Appendix D.  Assuming that the 
impervious area is 100% directly connected, the 
estimated annual mass removal efficiencies for 
this system are provided for each of the five meteorological zones in the column designated 80% 

DCIA.  In general, the highest estimated annual mass removal efficiencies would occur on a 

project site with a low non-DCIA curve numbe
r, while the lowest anticipated annual mass 
removal efficiencies would occur in a system 
constructed with a high non-DCIA curve number.  
Estimated annual mass removal efficiencies for a tr
eatment system with 1 inch of retention range 
from approximately 67.2-75.9% depending upon the pa
rticular meteorological region within the 
State.  The highest estimated annual removal effi
ciencies appear to occur in the central and 
coastal areas, with the lowest annual mass removal 
efficiencies occurring in the southeast coastal 
and panhandle areas of the State. 

 

 In summary, with the exception of projects 
constructed on highly permeable soils with 
low impervious percentages, current design crite
ria based on retention of the first 0.5-inch of 
runoff or 1.25 inches from the impervious area 
fail to meet the target annual mass pollutant 
removal efficiency of 80% for stormwater mana
gement systems outlined in the Water Resource 
Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40 FAC).  A
nnual mass removal efficiencies for retention 
systems vary substantially within the State of Florida between the designated meteorological 

zones. 

 

 The SJRWMD requires additional dry reten
tion treatment volume when the retention 
pond is constructed as an on-line system.  Fo
r on-line systems, the SJRWMD design criteria 
become either (1) 1-inch of runoff over the entir
e site; or (2) 1.25-inch over the impervious area 
plus 0.5-inch over the entire site, whichever is 
greater.  Estimated removal efficiencies for 
projects utilizing 1 inch of dry retention are su
mmarized in Appendix D.1.  Virtually all of the 
SJRWMD is located in the central zone (Zone 2)
.  As seen in Appendix D.1., an annual removal 
efficiency of 80% can be achieved using 1 inch 
of dry retention for most projects with a DCIA 
percentage of approximately 60-65% or less and 
a non-DCIA curve number of 80 or less.  If the 
site contains an impervious percentage in excess of 40%, the SJRWMD design criteria become 

1.25-inch over the impervious area plus 0.5-inch
 over the entire site.  Assuming a worst case 
impervious percentage of approximately 80%, th
is design criterion is equal to approximately 1.5 
inch of dry retention.  As seen in Appendix D.1, 1.5-
inch of dry retention in Zone 2 is capable of 
providing the required 80% annual mass removal effi
ciency for all combinations of DCIA and 
non-DCIA curve number.  This design criterion is
 the only current water management district 
dry retention design which meets the 80% 
annual load reduction goal for all possible 
combinations of DCIA and CN values. 

 

 
5.2.1.3 Design Criteria Based on Runoff
 
from a Specified Rainfall Event
 
 
 Design criteria for retention basins in th
e Suwannee River and Southwest Florida Water 
Management Districts are referenced in terms of 
the runoff generated by a specific rainfall event, 
typically a 1-inch event.  An evaluation of the an
ticipated annual performance efficiency of retention 
basins which are designed to provide treatment of
 runoff from a 1-inch rain event was performed 
using the continuous simulation methodology discussed previously.

 A summary of calculated annual mass removal efficiencies of dry retention ponds with a 

treatment volume equivalent to the 
runoff from 1 inch of rainfall is given in Table 5-7.  In general, 
the performance efficiency of retention ponds desi
gned to this criterion appear to be relatively 
constant for each of the evaluated combinations 
of DCIA and curve number, compared with the 
trend of decreasing performance efficiency with 
increases in DCIA percentage and non-DCIA curve 
numbers observed for treatment systems designed acco
rding to a specified runoff volume.  It is 
interesting to note that the anticipated removal effi ci
ency of the dry retention system increases as the 
impervious percentage increases.  This phenom
enon occurs because the generated runoff volume 
from 1 inch of rainfall, which dictates the desi
gn treatment volume, increases as the percentage 
DCIA increases.  As a result, removal efficiencies
 remain relatively constant, since the treatment 
volume changes in response to changes in project characteristics.  The maximum anticipated 

removal efficiencies which can be achieved using a dry retention system with a treatment volume 

equivalent to 1 inch of rainfall are approximately 54-61%.   

 

 A graphical comparison of calculated annual ma
ss removal efficiencies for dry retention of 
the runoff from 1 inch of rainfall for a hypotheti
cal development with 40%
 DCIA and a non-DCIA 
curve number of 70 is given in Figure 5-7 for each
 of the five zones.  Estimated annual mass 
removal efficiencies for this design range from
 approximately 50-57%, with the lowest removal 
efficiencies obtained in the Panhandle zone and 
the higher removal efficiencies obtained in the 
Central zone.  This design criterion also falls short 
of the 80% pollutant removal efficiency specified 
by the Water Resource Implementation Rule (Chapter 62-40).
