Estimates of the annual runoff coefficients 
for each of the developed land use categories 
were generated using the methodology outlined in
 Section 4.2.1 and the hydrologic characteristics 
summarized in Table 6-9.  Separate calculations were
 performed for each of the five meteorological 
zones and four hydrologic soil groups for each iden
tified land use category.  Separate calculations 
were performed for each of the hourly meteorological
 monitoring sites contained within each of the 
five zones, and the mean runoff coefficient wa
s calculated for each combination of development 
category, soil type, and zone. A summary of calcu
lated annual runoff coefficients for typical 
developed land use categories is given in Table 6-
10.   The values summarized in Table 6-10 reflect 
long-term average runoff coefficients based 
upon the available period of record for hourly 
meteorological sites within each of the five zones.
 In general, estimated annual runoff coefficients 
increase with changes in hydrologic soil group and increases in land use intensity.
