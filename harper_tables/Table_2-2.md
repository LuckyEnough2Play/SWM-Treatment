## Table 2-2 – Comparison of Stormwater Management System Design Criteria for Florida Water Management Districts

### Retention
| Design Parameter | St. Johns River WMD | Suwannee River WMD | Southwest Florida WMD | South Florida WMD |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Treatment Volume | Off-line: retain first 0.5" runoff or 1.25" from impervious area; on-line: retain first 1" runoff or 1.25" from impervious area plus 0.5" from the basin. Off-line design based on the 3‑yr/1‑hr storm. Projects ≥40% impervious or HSG A soils use 1" from impervious area. | Retention of the first 1" of rainfall | If project <100 ac, on-line retention of 0.5" runoff | Retention of the first 0.5" runoff or 1.25 × % imperviousness, whichever is greater |
| Volume Recovery | Design capacity recovered within 72 hr by percolation, evapotranspiration, etc. | Not referenced | Treatment volume recovered in ≤72 hr | No more than half recovered in 24 hr |
| Vegetation | Stabilized with permanent vegetation cover | Not referenced | Not referenced | Not referenced |

### Underdrain System
| Design Parameter | St. Johns River WMD | Suwannee River WMD | Southwest Florida WMD | South Florida WMD |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Treatment Volume | Same as retention | Not referenced | Not referenced | Not referenced |
| Volume Recovery | 72 hr via percolation or evapotranspiration | Not referenced | Not referenced | Not referenced |
| Vegetation | ≥2 ft of native soil between bottom and underdrain; designed with safety factor of 2 | Not referenced | Not referenced | Not referenced |

### Underground Exfiltration
| Design Parameter | St. Johns River WMD | Suwannee River WMD | Southwest Florida WMD | South Florida WMD |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Treatment Volume | Same as retention: off-line 0.5" runoff or 1.25" from impervious area | Not referenced | Storage of 1" of runoff from the first 1" of rainfall | Same as retention: 0.5" runoff or 1.25 × % imperviousness |
| Volume Recovery | Designed with safety factor of 2; recovery in 72 hr; trench invert ≥2 ft above SHWT | Not referenced | 72‑hr recovery by percolation only | 1‑hr recovery |

### Wet Detention
| Design Parameter | St. Johns River WMD | Suwannee River WMD | Southwest Florida WMD | South Florida WMD |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Treatment Volume | 1" runoff or 2.5 × % impervious | 1" runoff (detention of first 1") | 1" runoff | 1" runoff or 2.5 × % impervious |
| Volume Recovery | 50% bleed‑down in 24–30 hr | Not referenced | 50% in 60 hr; 100% in 120 hr | 90% in 24 hr |
| Residence Time | ≥14‑day minimum wet season residence (Jun–Oct) | Not referenced | Not referenced | Not referenced |
| Littoral Zone | 30% of pond at NWL; or 5% additional retention, or 0.65 pond volume | Not referenced | 35% of pond area at outfall | 2.5% of pond or 2.5% of pond plus littoral |
| Pond Depth | Mean >2.8 ft; max ≤12 ft | Not referenced | Not referenced | Recommended littoral area depth = 1–2 ft |
| Configuration | Length:Width ≥2:1 | Not referenced | Not referenced | 6:1 minimum width |

### Swales and Dry Detention
| Design Parameter | St. Johns River WMD | Suwannee River WMD | Southwest Florida WMD | South Florida WMD |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Swales – Treatment | Percolate 80% of runoff from 3‑yr/1‑hr storm | Same | Not referenced | Not referenced |
| Swales – Recovery | 72 hr recovery | 72 hr recovery | Not referenced | Not referenced |
| Dry Det. – Use | Use restricted where SHWT or soils limit; use <5 ac | None | Not referenced | Not referenced |
| Dry Det. – Treatment | Off-line detention of first 1" or 2.5 × % impervious | Detention of 1" runoff | Not referenced | Off-line detention of 0.75" or 1.38 × % impervious |
| Dry Det. – Recovery | 50% of treatment volume within 24–30 hr; no standing water >3 days | If discharges to sink, off-line detention of 1" runoff | Not referenced | 50% recovery in 24 hr |

### Detention with Filtration
| Design Parameter | St. Johns River WMD | Suwannee River WMD | Southwest Florida WMD | South Florida WMD |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
