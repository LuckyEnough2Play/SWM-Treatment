 The authority to delegate implementation of the Stormwater Management Program within 

the State of Florida from FDEP to
 the various water management districts is provided in Chapter 62-
40.431.  This section provides that water manage
ment districts which have implemented a 
Comprehensive Surface Water Management Progr
am under Part IV of Chapter 373 (Florida 
Statutes) shall be the chief administrators of the 
State Stormwater Management Program within their 
districts.   Using this authority, FDEP has de
legated  responsibility  for  the  Stormwater 
Management Program to the Suwannee River, St. 
Johns River, Southwest Florida, and the South 
Florida Water Management Districts. Each of th
ese water management districts has developed a 
unique set of stormwater design criteria, modeled after the minimum design criteria outlined in 

Chapter 62-25 FAC, and designed to achieve the mi
nimum stormwater treatment standards specified 
in Chapter 62-40 FAC (Water Resource Implementation Rule).

 FDEP has not delegated authority for regulati
on of stormwater discharges to the Northwest 
Florida Water Management District since this di
strict does not have the economic and technical 
resources to implement a Comprehensive Surface Wa
ter Management Program at this time.  As 
such, FDEP has retained implementation of the Stat
e Stormwater Management Program in this area 
and provides permitting services for all new developm
ent within the Northwest Florida district based 
upon the stormwater system design standards outlined in Chapter 62-25 FAC. 

 

 A comparison of existing stormwater manage
ment design system criteria within the St. 
Johns River, Suwannee River, Southwest Florid
a, and the South Florida Water Management 
Districts is given in Table 2-
2.  Design criteria are summarized for each type of stormwater 
management system referenced w
ithin each of the four districts, including treatment volume, volume 
recovery, vegetation requirements, residence time, 
depth, and system configuration.  Criteria which 
do not directly impact the performance efficiency 
of the stormwater system (such as side slopes, 
minimum pipe sizes, vegetative planting success rates, etc.) are not listed in Table 2-2. 

 

 Each of the four water management districts 
provides design criteria for dry retention basins. 
In general, retention requirements are typically
 equivalent to the runoff volume generated by the 
first 0.5-inch of runoff or 1 inch of rainfall.  
Distinctions between off-line and on-line systems are 
provided in the design criteria by 
the St. Johns River and the Southwest Florida Water Management 
Districts, with increases in retention volume 
required for on-line systems.  Volume recovery 
requirements for retention basins vary, ranging fr
om full volume recovery in less than 72 hours in 
the St. Johns River, Suwannee River, and Southw
est Florida Water Management Districts, to 
recovery of 50% of the treatment volume in 
24 hours in the South Florida Water Management 
District.  The St. Johns River Water Management Dist
rict requires the retention basin to be stabilized 
with pervious material or vegetative cover, while 
vegetative cover is not referenced by the remaining 
districts. 
 
 Specifications for underdrain systems ar
e provided by the St. Johns River Water 
Management District only, with treatment volume 
requirements similar to those specified for dry 
retention.  Underdrain systems are not referenced by the remaining water management districts. 

 

 Underground exfiltration is specifically refe
renced by the St. Johns River, Southwest 
Florida, and South Florida Water Management Di
stricts.  In general, the treatment volume 
requirements for underground exfiltration systems are 
identical to those required for dry retention by 
the districts.  However, volume recovery require
ments vary substantially, with volume recovery 
required within 1 hour by the South Florida Water 
Management District and within 72 hours by the 
St. Johns River and Southwest Florida Water Management Districts. 

 

 The use of swales for stormwater treatment is
 referenced by both the St. Johns River and the 
Suwannee River Water Management Districts.  Each 
of these districts requires percolation of 80% of 
the runoff generated from a 3-year
/1-hour storm within the swale system, with recovery of the 
treatment volume in less than 72 hours.  The use 
of swales for stormwater treatment is not 
specifically referenced by either the Southwes
t Florida or South Florida Water Management 
Districts.
