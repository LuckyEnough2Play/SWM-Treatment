Detailed study from 1975-1980 including streamflow, climate, 
physiogr aphic and water quality data.  Extremely detailed discussion 

of watershed characteristics.  Data presented in both concentration 

and loading rate formats.  Although land use is mixed, 3 of the 9 sites 

are approximately 70% residential which may be useful for single 

land use estimates.

Runoff collected from roadside swales during 17 storm events from 
1982-1983 using automatic collection equipment.  Data presented as

Nutrients, Metals 
Flow-weighted composite runoff samples collected for 22 storm 
events during 1984.  Grass swales with raised inlets used for 

conveyance and treatment.  Data presented as both concentration and 

loading rates.  Detailed hydrologic and watershed information.  

Presence of swale drainage/treatme
nt system limits usefulness for 
characterization data.

Heavy MetalsFlow-weighted runoff samples collected at inlet to wet detention 
pond during 16 storm events from April 1983-May 1984 with a wide 

range of total rainfall and anteced
ent rainfall conditions.  No pre-
treatment. Data presented as concentration only.  Detailed hydrologic 

and rain event characteristics provided.
