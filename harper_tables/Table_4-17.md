 The mean runoff characteristics summarized 
in Table 4-17 are recommended for use in 
general runoff characterization and loading studies w
ithin the State of Florida.  However, in areas 
where more site-specific runoff characterization in
formation is available, the site-specifi c data 
should be used instead of the generalized data summarized in Table 4-17. 

  

 

 Several assumptions were made in assigni
ng runoff concentrations to provide a more 
complete database for the general land use categorie
s.  First, runoff characterization data was not 
available for copper, lead, or zinc in low-density 
residential land uses in the literature.  Therefore, 
to provide estimates of runoff characteristics for th
ese parameters, typical concentrations of copper, 
lead, and zinc in low-density residential areas are 
assumed to be equal to 50% of the mean values 
listed for single-family residential.  Heavy metal c
oncentrations were also not available for copper, 
lead, or zinc for mining/extractive land uses.  
As a result, runoff concentrations for these 
parameters in mining/extractive areas are assumed 
to be similar to concentrations observed in 
industrial areas.  Pollutant contributions from 
mining activities are generated primarily from the 
movement of trucks and automobiles along access roads into and out of the site, as well as parking 

lots and garages.  These activities are very similar to those occurring in industrial areas.

4.2  Estimation of Runoff Quantities
 
 
 Estimates of annual and event-based runoff volum
es were calculated to evaluate variability 
in regional runoff generation and the performance e
fficiencies of dry retention systems.  These 
calculations were performed using the SCS 
(Soil Conservation Service) Curve Number 
Methodology and the historical rainfa
ll data sets for meteorological sites discussed in Section 4.1. 
A discussion of the methodology and results of this modeling is given in the following sections. 

 

 
4.2.1 Methodology
 
 
 The SCS curve number methodology utilizes se
parate calculations for the runoff volume 
generated from directly connected impervious ar
eas (DCIA) and non-DCIA areas.  An impervious 
area is considered to be directly connected if r
unoff from the area flows dir
ectly into the drainage 
conveyance system, such as a gutter or stormsewer
.  Areas are also considered to be directly 
connected if runoff from the area occurs as a con
centrated shallow flow that is conveyed through a 
pervious area, such as a roadside swale, and th
en into a drainage system.  The SCS curve number 
method assumes that after allotting for initial abstraction, all rainfall which occurs on directly 

connected impervious areas becomes stormwater runoff. 

 

 Non-directly connected impervious areas 
(non-DCIA) include all pervious areas and 
portions of impervious areas which are not consid
ered to be directly connected.  The SCS model 
assumes that runoff generated in these areas has th
e opportunity to infiltrate into the soil, depending 
upon the soil types and land cover characteristics, be
fore significant runoff volumes begin to be 
generated within the area.  The runoff generati
ng characteristics of non-DCIA areas are quantified 
through the use of a curve number (CN).  A curve 
number is a hydrologic factor which is used to 
reflect the runoff potential of a particular land us
e and soil type.  Theoretical values for curve 
numbers range from 0-100, with low values refl
ecting a low runoff potential and higher values 
reflecting a high runoff potential.  Representative cu
rve numbers can be obtained from a variety of 
sources,  although  the  original  source  of  these 
 data  was  published  by  the  Natural  Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS) as Technical Release 55 titled ﬁUrban Hydrology for Small 

Watershedsﬂ dated June 1986.  This reference provi
des an extensive listing of curve numbers for 
different hydrologic soil groups and land use covers. 

 

 The TR 55 document divides soil groups with
in the United States into Hydrologic Soil 
Groups (HSG) which groups general soil types with 
respect to runoff-producing characteristics.  A 
summary of the characteristics of the designated 
hydrologic soil groups, identified as A, B, C, and 
D, is given in Table 4-18.   The primary consid
eration in assigning soils to the general soil group 
types is the inherent capacity of the bare soil to
 permit infiltration.  Soils classified in HSG A 
consist primarily of deep sandy soils, with a high infiltration rate and a low runoff potential.  The 

vast majority of rainfall which occurs in these ar
eas is absorbed by infiltration and does not become 
stormwater runoff.  Soils classified in HSG D c
onsist of clayey-type soils or soils with a high 
organic content which exhibit a low infiltration ra
te and a high runoff potential.  A large portion of 
the rainfall which occurs on soils in this classification ultimately becomes stormwater runoff.
