 The mean stormwater characteristics summari
zed in Table 4-10 are intended for use only 
where highway/transportation is the dominant land use 
category in a particular area.  As indicated 
previously, stormwater characteristics summarized
 in this table are most appropriate for 
expressways, interstate highway systems, and heavily
 traveled roadways.  Roadways associated with 
other land use categories, such as residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture, open space, and 

mining/extractive, are included in the stormwat
er characteristics presented for each of these 
categories.  Therefore, roadway areas for these 
land use types should not be evaluated separately 
since runoff generated on the roadway surfaces is 
mixed with runoff generated from the dominant 
land use category. 
 

 
4.1.9 AgriculturalAreas
 
 
 Agricultural land use within Florida is extr
emely varied, both in terms of agricultural 
activities and soil types.  Agricultural activities su
ch as cattle grazing and row crops are commonly 
conducted on poorly drained soils which are charact
erized by a relatively high runoff potential.  
Citrus, however, requires well drained soils with a 
much lower runoff potential than those typically 
associated with grazing or row crop activities.  For 
these reasons, a wide range of  agricultural uses 
and characteristics must be considered to obtain re
presentative emc values appropriate for specific 
agricultural activities.  For purposes of this analysis
, agricultural activities in Florida are divided into 
three primary categories, including pasture land, c
itrus, and row crops.  Su
fficient characterization 
data currently exists within the literature to provi
de separate runoff characteristics for each of these 
three categories.

4.1.9.1  Pasture Land Use
 
 
 Three separate studies were identified in the literature review which provide runoff 

characterization data for pasture land use.  A 
summary of hydrologic characteristics from these 
pasture land use studies is given in Table B.7.  Wa
tershed sizes for the evaluated areas range from 
21.6-155,741 acres.  Each of the three study sites occurred on relatively poorly drained soils. 

 

 A summary of emc values from pasture land 
use studies is given in Table 4-11.  Runoff 
characterization data is provided in each of the 
three studies for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, 
with BOD and TSS provided in two of the th
ree studies.  Measurement of heavy metal 
concentrations was not conducted in any of the studies
.  In general, pasture land use appears to have 
runoff concentrations for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and TSS which are substantially greater 

than concentrations observed in residential or commercial areas.
