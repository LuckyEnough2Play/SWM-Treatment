 For this evaluation, cluster analysis was c
onducted for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 clusters.  There 
is no standard technique to determine the optimum
 number of clusters which should be chosen to 
represent a particular data set.  However, the 
elbow criterion is a common rule of thumb which is 
often used to determine the appropriate number of
 clusters to be selected.  The elbow criterion 
indicates that you should select a 
number of clusters so that adding an additional cluster does not 
provide a significant amount of additional informati
on in the model.  This criterion is typically 
evaluated using the percentage of variance expl
ained for each cluster model.  A graph of the 
percentage of variance and annual runoff coeffici
ents explained as a function of the number of 
clusters is given in Figure 4-2.  As the curve begi
ns to approach the 4- or 5-cluster models, the 
additional variance explained by adding an additiona
l cluster to the model becomes incrementally 
small.  Therefore, an appropriate number of cluste
rs for the annual runoff coefficients model appears 
to be approximately 4 or 5.  The 5-cluster analys
is was selected as the final model because this 
model identified the Florida Keys as unique in te
rms of annual runoff coefficients compared with 
other areas throughout the State of Florida.  
ERD has conducted stormwater and meteorological 
monitoring throughout the State of Florida, includi
ng the Florida Keys, and has firsthand knowledge 
of the substantially different meteorological processes which occur within the Florida Keys 

compared with other areas within the State of Florid
a.  As a result of this firsthand experience, the 5-
cluster model was selected.

 A graphical summary of the results of the 
cluster analysis is given in Figure 4-3. 
Meteorological monitoring sites with similar runo
ff generating characteristics are grouped together 
by color on this figure.  Approximate areas repr
esented by the clustered meteorological monitoring 
sites are shaded in similar colors, generally on a County-wide basis.  The majority of the indicated 

zones appear to be intuitive with respect to va
riability in rainfall events throughout the State. 
Portions of the Panhandle have been clustered t
ogether in an area which is impacted by a high 
number of large frontal events.  Portions of the St
ate along the Gulf Coast also appear to be similar 
runoff generating characteristics.  Central and Cent
ral-Coastal portions of Florida also appear to 
have similar runoff characteristics.  Runoff patterns 
in Southeast Florida appear to be dissimilar to 
rainfall patterns in other areas of the State.  The 
Florida Keys are also identified on Figure 4-3 as a 
unique meteorological zone.  The meteorological
 zones indicated on Figure 4-3 are utilized 
throughout the remainder of this report for eval
uating runoff generation, pollutant loadings, and 
stormwater management system performance.

 Unfortunately, not all counties in Florida have long-term meteorological monitoring sites 

with hourly data.  For purposes of designating me
teorological zones, counties without a monitoring 
site were grouped according to the meteorologi
cal characteristics of adjacent counties with 
monitoring sites.  The resulting zones appear to be
 relatively intuitive with respect to meteorological 
processes.  The cluster groupings only have tw
o apparent outliers, Daytona Beach and Tamiami 
Trail, which appear out of place.  However, in a 
data set containing 45 points, an analysis conducted 
at a 95% probability level would be expected to ha
ve approximately 2-3 outlier values.  A listing of 
counties included in each meteorological zone is given in Table 4-23.
