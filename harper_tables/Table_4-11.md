A relatively large degree of variability appears 
to exist between runoff concentrations from 
the three pasture land use areas.  These differences 
are particularly apparent in the measured runoff 
concentrations for total nitrogen, total phosphorus
, and TSS in the St. Cloud study.  The studies 
performed in the St. Johns River Basin and in 
Ash Slough present hydrologic and water quality data 
at the farm boundaries after transport through conveyance systems to the point of discharge from the 

farm.  These measured values reflect the effect
s of pollutant uptake and attenuation during travel 
through conveyance systems such as canals or on-site detention ponds.  This type of value is more 

representative of runoff characteristics which actually discharge from large farm basin areas.  
 

However, the St. Cloud study represents water qua
lity data measured directly as runoff from 
the field area prior to entering adjacent canals and d
itches and, as a result, does not include pollutant 
uptake and deposition of suspended solids and nutrien
ts within conveyance systems located within 
the farm.  As a result, the total nitrogen, total phos
phorus, and TSS values obtained at this site are 
substantially greater than those obtained at the other sites.  Nevertheless, this value is included in 

estimation of mean values for pasture land use to
 account for pasture areas that discharge rapidly 
into off-site drainage systems.

4.1.9.2  Citrus Land Use
 
 
Seven runoff characterization st
udies involving citrus land use were identified during the 
literature review.  Soil types represented in th
ese studies are generally poorly drained soils, 
consisting of fine grain sands, peat, or muck.  The wa
ter table elevations in most of these studies was 
controlled by furrows and lateral ditches to keep th
e root zone of the plants dry.  A summary of 
hydrologic characteristics from the citrus land use studies is given in Table B.8.  Watershed sizes 

included in the land use characterization studies
 range from 184-56,868 acres. Studies included in 
this category were conducted from 1987-1997. 
 

A summary of emc values from the citrus land 
use studies is given in Table 4-12.  Each of 
the seven studies provides characterization data 
for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, with two 
studies providing data for BOD, a
nd five studies providing studies for TSS.  Information on heavy 
metal characteristics from citrus land uses is extremely limited. In ge ne ra l , c i t rus l a nd use  a ppea rs 

to have moderate concentrations for total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus, with relatively low 
concentrations for BOD, TSS, and heavy metals.
