4.1.9.3  Row Crops Land Use
  
 
 Eight separate studies were identified in the literature which provide stormwater 

characterization data for row crop activities.  
A summary of hydrologic characteristics from row 
crop stormwater studies in Florida is given in
 Table B.9.  Watershed areas included in these 
studies range from 12-5680 acres, although half of 
the sites did not include information on the 
watershed area.  Soil types included in the areas
 are a combination of sand and muck soils.  
Studies included for characterization of
 row crops were performe d from 1987-2002.

 A summa ry of emc values from row crop st
ormwater studies is given in Table 4-13.  
Each of the eight studies provide characteriza
tion data for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, 
with five of the studies providing informati
on for TSS, and none of the studies providing 
information for BOD.  Information on heavy metal characteristics is included in three of the 

eight studies.  In general, nutrient concentrations 
measured in row crop areas appear to be similar 
to those observed in pasture land use areas, a
lthough measured TSS concentrations in row crop 
areas appear to be substantially lower than those observed in pasture areas.
