5.1.5 Comparison of Treatment Efficiencies
 
for Typical Stormwater Management Systems
 
 
A comparison of treatment efficiencies for t
ypical stormwater management systems used 
in the State of Florida is gi
ven in Table 5-5 based upon information provided in the literature 
review.  Comparative removal efficiencies are 
provided for dry retention, wet detention, and dry 
detention.  For the purposes of the evaluation, rete
ntion is considered any method of infiltrating 
water into the ground.  This includes traditional re
tention ponds, stormwater reuse, swales, or the 
use of exfiltration trenches.
