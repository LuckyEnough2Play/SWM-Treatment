 Wet detention stormwater treatment is specifi
cally referenced by all the water management 
districts except the Suwannee River Water Manageme
nt District.   However, the Suwannee River 
Water Management District provides general detenti
on criteria which could be interpreted as either 
wet or dry systems.  In the three districts that
 provide references for wet detention, the required 
treatment volume is equivalent to 1 inch of runo
ff from the watershed or 2.5 inches of runoff from 
the impervious area, whichever is greater.  Volume recovery requirements are variable, with 

recovery of 50% of the treatment volume in 24-
30 hours in the St. Johns River Water Management 
District, 50% in 60 hours and 100% in 120 hours in
 the Southwest Florida Water Management 
District, and 50% recovery in 24 hours in the Sout
h Florida Water Management District.  Residence 
time, perhaps the most significant factor in determ
ining the overall performance efficiency of a wet 
detention system, is referenced only by the St. 
Johns River Water Management District which 
requires a minimum 14-day wet season residence 
time during the months from June-October. 
Littoral zone plantings are required by each of the 
three water management districts, ranging from 
20% in the South Florida Water Management Dist
rict to 35% in the Southwest Florida Water 
Management District.  Require
ments for pond depth, also an important design parameter, are 
provided by the St. Johns River a
nd South Florida Water Management Districts.  The St. Johns 
River Water Management District specifies sha
llow ponds, with a mean depth ranging from 2-8 ft 
and a maximum depth of 12 ft.  In contrast, 
the South Florida Water Management District 
recommends that 25-50% of the pond area be greater 
than 12 ft to provide storage for accumulated 
solids. 

 

 Specific references to design criteria for dry 
detention (without filtration) are provided by the 
St. Johns River and South Florida Water Manage
ment Districts.  The Suwannee River Water 
Management District mentions ﬁdetentionﬂ whic
h could be inferred to mean dry detention.  
Treatment volume requirements are somewhat variab
le, with 1 inch of runoff (or 2.5 inches from 
impervious areas) in an off-line system in the St
. Johns River Water Management District, the runoff 
from 1 inch of rainfall in the Suwannee River Wate
r Management District, and 0.5 inch of runoff (or 
1.88 inches x impervious area) in the South Florid
a Water Management District.  Volume recovery 
is also highly variable, with recovery of 50% 
of the treatment volume in 24 hours by the St. Johns 
River and South Florida Water Management District
s, and complete recovery in 72 hours within the 
Suwannee River Water Management District. 

 

 Detention with filtration systems are referen
ced by the St. Johns River, Suwannee River, and 
Southwest Florida Water Management Districts.  
In general, the treatment volume requirements for 
detention with filtration systems are identical to those required for dry retention systems. 

Specifi cations are also provided for the filter system which are virtually identical to the filter system 

criteria outlined in Chapter 62-25.  Treatment 
volume recovery ranges from 36 hours in the 
Southwest Florida Water Management District 
to 72 hours in the St. Johns River and Suwannee 
River Water Management Districts. 

 

 Each of the four water management distri
cts provides additional supplemental criteria for 
stormwater management systems which discharge 
to OFW, Class I or II waterbodies, or sensitive 
areas.  In general, an additional 50% treatment 
volume is required by the St. Johns River, Suwannee 
River, South Florida, and Southwest Florida Wate
r Management Districts for discharges to these 
waterbodies.  In addition to the enhanced treatme
nt volume, the St. Johns River Water Management 
District also requires an additional 50% perman
ent pool volume for wet detention ponds.  The South 
Florida Water Management District also requires additional assurances in the form of pre-treatment 

or other listed options. 

 

FDEP \ STORMWATER  TREATMENT  REPORT

 Basin-specific criteria have been developed 
by the St. Johns River and South Florida Water 
Management Districts to address flooding and water qua
lity concerns in sensitive basins.  In general, 
these basin-specific criteria require additional 
water quality treatment and/or water quantity 
protection within designated basins to achieve specific water quantity or water quality goals. 
 
 Each of the water management districts also
 provides design criteria which regulate the rate 
of discharge of stormwater from
 developed properties to prevent flooding.  In general, the post-
development rate of discharge for most projects is 
limited to values equal to or less than those which 
occur from the project site under pre-development 
conditions, generally for a 25-year design storm.  
However, since these criteria do not directly rela
te to the water quality aspects of stormwater 
management systems, they are not included in the discussion presented in this section. 

 

 
2.3  Local Governments
 
 
 In addition to the design criteria summarized in previous sections, local governments may 

also develop stormwater design criteria, includi
ng alternative design criteria, provided that the 
design criteria meet the overall objectives and wa
ter quality goals achieved by the design criteria 
provided by each of the water management dist
ricts.  Local governments typically include 
supplemental design criteria related to maintenance, safety, and aesthetic aspects of stormwater 

management systems such as maintenance berms, 
fencing, and design criteria for outfall structures 
to minimize transport of trash and other debris to downstream waterbodies. 

 

 Several governmental entities, such as Ma
rtin County and Leon County, have developed 
alternative stormwater design criteria designed to reduce post-development loadings from developed 

areas to levels equal to or less than pre-developmen
t loadings in areas within
 their jurisdiction.  In 
Martin County, this strategy was implemented on a 
county-wide basis, while in Leon County this 
strategy was developed only for the Bradfordville area.  In general, the design criteria developed for 

these areas to achieve no net increase in lo
adings under post-development conditions are 
substantially greater with respect to treatment vol
ume than existing design criteria currently utilized 
within the State of Florida.

SECTION  3 
 

 PRECIPITATION 
CHARACTERISTICS  IN  FLORIDA
 
 
 

 The need for stormwater treatment in Florid
a is fueled by the abundance of rainfall which 
occurs throughout the State.  The close proximity 
of Florida to the Atlan
tic Ocean and Gulf of 
Mexico, along with the State™s many inland lake
s and waterways, combine to generate high 
humidity and generally abundant and frequent 
rainfall.  However, although precipitation is 
generally abundant in Florida, annual precipitati
on amounts can vary greatly from year to year, 
and serious droughts have occurred periodically 
within the State.  Rainfall is unevenly 
distributed throughout the year in Florida, with
 more than half of the total annual rainfall 
occurring during the period from June-September 
when periods of extremely heavy rainfall are 
common.  The highest 24-hour rainfall ever record
ed in the United States, 38.7 inches, occurred 
in Yankeetown, Florida on September 5-6, 1950. 

 

 
3.1  Annual and Regional Precipitation
 
 
 In addition to variability in seasonal rainfall 
characteristics, a significant regional variability 
in annual precipitation has been observed throughout th
e State of Florida.  A
ccording to the National 
Climatic Data Center (NCDC), 111 meteorological 
stations are maintained throughout the State of 
Florida.  During February 2002, the NCDC released a summary of monthly and annual temperature 

and precipitation measurements at each of the 
111 stations over the 30-year period from 1971-2000. 
A summary of this information, including a loca
tion map for each of the 111 monitoring sites, is 
given in Appendix A.1. 

 

 A contour isopleth map of mean annual preci
pitation within the State of Florida was 
generated by ERD based upon the mean annual preci
pitation values for the 111 monitoring sites 
summarized in Appendix A.1.  Data from additiona
l meteorological monitoring sites in Alabama, 
Georgia, and Louisiana (generally within 100 mile
s of Florida) were also obtained to provide a 
smoother transition for the contour lines in the vici
nity of the State boundary.  The mean rainfall data 
obtained from these adjacent stations was also
 provided by the NCDC as summaries of data 
collected over the period 1971-2000.  An additional 
49 meteorological monitoring locations were 
included in this supplemental data set, for a total of 160 meteorological monitoring sites used for 

generation of rainfall contour isopleths.  A comple
te listing of geographical coordinates and mean 
annual rainfall from 1971-2000 is given in Appendix 
A.2 for each of the 160 monitoring sites, and 
locations of these monitoring sites are shown on Figure 3-1.

 An isopleth map of annual precipitation within 
the State of Florida during the 30-year period 
from 1971-2000, generated using the process outlined prev
iously, is given in Figure 3-2.  In general, 
average rainfall within the State ranges from approximately 38-66 inches/year, depending upon 

location within the State.  The greatest annual pr
ecipitation within the State occurs in western 
portions of the Florida Panhandle.  In addition to
 the summer time convective storms which affect 
most of the State, this area is also impacted
 by precipitation from frontal boundaries which often 
dissipate before reaching more southern portions of
 the State.  The lowest annual precipitation was 
recorded in the Florida Keys.   Expanded regional ve
rsions of the rainfall isopleths map are given in 
Appendix A.3.

 Additional regions of elevated rainfall, with annual precipitation ranging from approximately 

58-62 inches/year, are apparent in the Big Bend Coastal and the Southeast Coastal regions of the 

State.  The Big Bend Coastal area is impacted 
by many of the same precipitation processes that 
occur within the Panhandle region, while the Sout
heast Coastal region is impacted heavily by 
summer time convective thunderstorm activity.  The remaining portions of the State, excluding the 

Florida Keys, have annual precipitation ranging from
 approximately 45-55 inches/year, with lower 
precipitation in central portions of the State and higher precipitation in coastal areas.   

 

 In addition to the regional variability in m
ean annual precipitation illustrated on Figure 3-2, a 
significant variability also exists w
ith respect to the frequency and types of individual rain events 
which occur throughout the state.  For example, coasta
l areas (particularly in southern portions of the 
State) often have small convective rainfall events
 due to the proximity of open water.  A large 
number of the rain events which o
ccurred in these areas are less than 0.2 inches.  In contrast, areas 
within the Panhandle receive a large portion of th
eir annual rainfall from periodic frontal boundaries 
which typically dissipate before reaching other parts of the State.   

 

 The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)
 has collected long-term rainfall data at 
numerous precipitation recording stations within the St
ate of Florida.  This database was reviewed to 
identify rainfall recording stations which would be representative of rainfall conditions in various 

areas of the State.  Eleven separate meteorologi
cal stations were selected, scattered from the 
Panhandle to the Florida Keys, to examine variability 
in the characteristics of individual rain events 
across the State.  Locations of the selected me
teorological sites are indicated on Figure 3-3.  In 
general, it was desired that the monitoring stati
ons contain a maximum period of record with a 
minimum amount of missing data.   Years within th
e period of record which contain one or more 
months  of  missing  data  were  generally  excluded 
 from  the  database,  providing  a  data set with 
continuous rainfall data for each year included within the set. 

 

 Characteristics of the selected meteorological 
sites in Florida are summarized in Table 3-1. 
This table includes a descriptive name to identif
y the general location of the monitoring site, the 
mean annual rainfall measured at the monitoring 
site, and the period of record included in the 
meteorological data.  Continuous rainfall records 
were initiated in 1942 at seven of the 11 sites 
included in Table 3-1.  Records at four add
itional sites were begun between 1946 and 1949.  The 
period of rainfall records included in data sets fo
r each of the 11 sites is 
summarized in the final 
column of Table 3-1.  Each entry includes the peri
od of record as well as 
the number of years of 
complete data available for evaluation of rain event characteristics.
