 A summary of mean runoff coefficients for each cluster as a function of land use and 

hydrologic soil group is given in Tabl
e 4-24.  The values summarized in this table reflect the mean 
runoff coefficients for each land use and hydrol
ogic soil group and each meteorological monitoring 
site included in each of the five clusters.  The va
lues summarized in Table 4-24 reflect differences in 
runoff coefficients as a result of 
frequency distributions of common rain events only.  This analysis 
does not include variability in rainfall depth throughout the State which must be multiplied times the 

mean runoff coefficients to obtain an estimate of annual runoff volume.
