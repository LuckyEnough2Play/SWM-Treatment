4.1.9.4  Comparison of Agricultural Characteristics
 
 
 A comparison of emc values from pasture, 
citrus, and row crop agricultural activities is 
given in Table 4-14.  Pasture land use appears to 
have the largest mean concentration for total 
nitrogen, total phosphorus, and TSS.  The lowest concen
trations for these parameters occur for citrus 
land use.  

 

 A category of general agriculture is also included in the final row of Table 4-14.  This 

category simply reflects the arithmetic mean of the listed characteristics for pasture, citrus, and row 

crop activities and is intended as a generic represen
tation of agricultural activities for use in studies 
where information on specific agricultural activities is not known.

4.1.10 Undeveloped/Rangeland/Forest Land Use
 
 
 The category of undeveloped/rangeland/fo
rest land use includes open spaces and 
undeveloped land occupied by native vegetation, forests, and rangeland.  These areas are typically 

characterized by little or no impervious area and 
a relatively low runoff potential throughout most 
of the year. 

 

 Five separate runoff characterization studies
 were identified which measured undeveloped, 
rangeland, or forest land use areas.  A summary of 
hydrologic characteristics from these studies is 
given in Table B.10.  The evaluated studies ra
nge from Tallahassee to Miami.  However, 
information on watershed area is not provided for a
ny of the studies since delineation of watersheds 
for natural areas is often difficult.  Land use in
 the evaluated studies includes flatwood, rangeland, 
open spaces, and forests, and studies were conducted over the years from 1977-2004. 

 

 A summary of emc values from the undevel
oped, rangeland, and forest stormwater studies 
is given in Table 4-15.  Each of the five studies provides characterization data for total nitrogen and 

total phosphorus, with three studies providing data 
for BOD, and four studi
es providing data for 
TSS.  Heavy metal characteristics for copper, l
ead, and zinc are included in only one study.  In 
general, undeveloped, rangeland, and forest la
nd uses are characterized by relatively low 
concentrations for each of the available parameters summarized in Table 4-15.
